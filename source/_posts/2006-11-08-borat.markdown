I saw Borat this weekend and though I would say it was good, it feels like a stretch to make the character's exploits into a full-length film.  I think I'll see [Sacha Baron Cohen's](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056187/) next movie when it comes out on DVD.  Also, see this [interesting piece](http://www.slate.com/id/2152789/?nav=ais) on how Borat's portrayal of Kazakhstan compares to the real nation.
