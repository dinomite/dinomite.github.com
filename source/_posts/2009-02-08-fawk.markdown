There are a lot of old-school Unix commands that can be strung together to form miniatures programs a solution where one doesn't already exist.  Often times, they're great for nothing more than trimming the output from command line programs to make ocular searching easier.  `awk` is one of these great little text processing utilities, though I usually find myself using it in only it's simplest fashion: to print a specific record from a line of input.
<pre class="brush: bash;">Caligula:~$ df -h|awk '{print $2}'
698Gi
298Gi
190Gi</pre>
That `awk` command, `'{print $2}'`, is more than a bit cumbersome to type, so I keyed up a quick function in my `.bashrc` to make performing this quick operation easier:
<pre class="brush: bash;">Caligula:~$ df -h|fawk 2
698Gi
298Gi
190Gi</pre>
And the function:
<pre class="brush: bash;">function fawk {
    first="awk '{print "
    last="}'"
    cmd="${first}$${1}${last}"
    eval $cmd
}</pre>
