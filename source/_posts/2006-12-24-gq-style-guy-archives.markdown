I found the archives of the [GQ Style Guy](http://men.style.com/gq/fashion/styleguy) today, which has answered numerous style questions I had.  It's also peppered with some serious wit:

<blockquote>The only people doomed to pulling off pills [from a sweater] one by one are those in hell who, while they were alive, washed my cashmere socks in hot water and then put them in the dryer.</blockquote>
