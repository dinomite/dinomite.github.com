When walking through Ikea one day, I spotted the perfect bottles in which to make Skittles vodka.  Starting with these, here is the process for making this infusion.

<h2>Sorting</h2>

The first tedious part of this process is sorting the Skittles into their various colors (ostensibly, flavors).  I sat down in front of the [Singapore Grand Prix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Singapore_Grand_Prix) with six plates: one for each of the five Skittles colors and an extra on which to dump packages for sorting.  I bough a box of 36 normal-size (61 gram) packages of Skittles from Costco and ended up using 22 of the packs.  To sort them, I poured a few packages onto one of the plates and separated the candies onto the five others.

After consulting <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Shoot-the-Rainbow-Skittles-Vodka/">other</a> who had <a href="http://mixthatdrink.com/skittles-vodka-tutorial/">made Skittles vodka</a>, I settled on needing 240 Skittles per liter of vodka.

<h2>Assembly</h2>
Now comes the easy part.  To get the Skittles into my narrow-mouthed bottles, I made a simple paper funnel and carefully poured the candies in.  Easy.  Then, I just used my liquid funnel to fill each bottle with vodka.

<h2>Shake and Wait</h2>
After each of the containers was filled, I gave them a quick shake; within a few hours, much of the candies had dissolved.  I left them overnight, and by the next day all that was left was a small bed of white pebbles in the bottom of each bottle.

<h2>Filter</h2>
<p>Finally, the filtration.  This step is the most difficult, because it requires a lot of patience even though you're almost done!</p>

<p>A lot of the mass of Skittles is binderâ€”corn starch and the like.  It leaves a significant amount of scum onthe top of your Skittles vodka mix.  To strain it off, I started by using standard office coffee filters, but those clogged very quickly.  I switched to normal paper towels, which made filtering take about 5 minutes per bottle.  After filtering, re-bottle and enjoy your super-sweet vodka rainbow!</p>
