[Richard Dawkins'](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/113) talk from the 2002 [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com) was recently posted on the web (ok, it was a year ago, but I just saw it) and it's a very good summary of his views militant atheism.  Now, Dawkins isn't advocating violence in support of atheism, unlike that done by [so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Natan-Zada) [many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization) [religious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism) [groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_Islam), but rather supporting of [strong atheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_and_strong_atheism) and an end to religion.

<blockquote>In my view, not only is science is corrosive to religion and religion is corrosive to science.  It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations we have within our grasp.  It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence.</blockquote>
