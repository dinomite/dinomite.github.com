Top Gear did a [Man v. Machine segment](http://youtube.com/watch?v=MCyrDZmCijk) a few months ago pitting a Peugeot 207 against a couple of [traceurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour).  It was a very entertaining clip and showed some good parkour moves as well.  If you're interested in parkour, however, even more interesting is a short video on the site of the [Worldwide Jam street team](http://www.worldwidejam.tv/streetteam.1.parkour.html) about the [making of the Top Gear segment](http://www.worldwidejam.tv/topgear.parkour.jam.html).  Unsurprisingly, each shot was done separately, some of them with some stunt assistance such as mats.
