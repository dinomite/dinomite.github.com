Almost every time I get into my Mom's car, I find that the radio is coming from the front-right speaker only.  You see, she has an Acura TL which has a stereo that features two main knobs.  Pushing the left knob turns it on or off and turning it adjusts the volume.  The right knob is used for tuning the radio but can also adjust output characteristics (bass, treble, fade and balance) which are cycled through by pushing the knob.  It seems that when attempting to tune the radio she may accidentally push in the knob causing any further turning of said knob to adjust the bass and treble to full and shift the sound all the way to the right side, front most speaker.  This isn't her fault; she's driving and ought to be able to easily fumble with the radio to make adjustments without looking down.  This is a case of bad user interface design.
