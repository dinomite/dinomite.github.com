I was just watching a [Daily Show clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv4vj_vlIOw) featuring [Senator Robert Byrd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd), who just recently surpassed [Strom Thurmond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond) as the longest serving senator in history.  Aside from his avowed obsession with [pork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_barrel), he is quite the screwball and reminds me a lot of [Foghorn Leghorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn).  Foghorn is, incidentally, named after the character [Senator Claghorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Claghorn).
