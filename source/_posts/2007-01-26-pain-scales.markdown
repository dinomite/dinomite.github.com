While reading about [capsaicin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin) and [the Scoville scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale) on [my favorite website](http://en.wikipedia.org), I noticed the [Shmidt Sting Pain Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_Sting_Pain_Index) was listed.  Like so often happens when browsing Wikipedia, this led me to read about other [pain indices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_scale).  Other than the Wong-Baker scale shown at the top of the page, I didn't know that there were such defined scales.
