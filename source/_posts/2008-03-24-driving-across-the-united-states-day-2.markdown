The second day started with a trip through Memphis, TN to stop by [Graceland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland), not because either of us particularly care about Elvis but it's a major stop for Americana, so you can't just drive by.  Surprisingly, even on Easter this landmark of tackiness was open and visitors could take a tour of the mansion, were they so inclined.  This was of little interest so, after a couple of pictures, we drove on to Arkansas with a stop to see the Mississippi river up close.  The river is incredibly wide as everyone has always heard and it was moving quite quickly due to recent rains.

In Arkansas, the terrain more or less continued getting a bit flatter as we moved on.  Little Rock isn't very big and the sparsely populated terrain continues all the way to Dallas except for the border town of [Texarkana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit).  [Dallas-Fort Worth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas/Fort_Worth_Metroplex) is as huge as one would expect, but we were on our way to [Abilene, TX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene,_Texas) which held another pleasant gastronomic surprise.  In Abilene we had dinner at the [Lytle Land and Cattle Co.](http://www.lytlelandandcattle.com/) which served undoubtedly the finest steak I have ever had.  I wouldn't have believed prior to this that a steak could be so good and it's surely due mostly to the quality of the local beef.  Texas is, unsurprisingly, a great place to get a steak and I am now inclined to try [Omaha Steaks](http://www.omahasteaks.com) that you can get by mail.
