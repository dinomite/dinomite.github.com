There are a number of Ska songs that mention foods or, in this case, a recipe.  The following is from Greenhouse's *Palabras*, which I have on the album *Skarmageddon 3* but, as I just found on Amazon, is on their own album, [Tomorrow The World](http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-World-Greenhouse/dp/B000006AUS/ref=pd_bbs_3/105-7333297-0074842?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1184553769&sr=1-3).

	Now in a cup dissolve two bags of yeast
	Let it stand and then proof and diffuse
	Get a cup of sugar, of flour 4
	Mix it up and let it stand some more

	Get the greasy pan, oil top the dough
	Let it rise and when...
	Give it 25 minutes, 400 degrees
	Some times I cut it up and eat blue cheese
