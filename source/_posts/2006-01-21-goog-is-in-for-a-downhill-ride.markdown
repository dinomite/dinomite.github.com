Like many people, since the day Google had it's IPO I was wishing that I could have gotten in on that action.  By the end of the month, when the stock continued to rise, I still sort of wished that I had bought some shortly after the IPO, but the thought of "man, $130 for a volatile internet stock? it can't keep rising," and yet, it has continued to rise steadily, until this week when rumors of Google being targeted by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">DOJ</a> surfaced and <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=goog>GOOG</a> dropped 8% in just two days.  The forever-climbing nature of Google's stock has made it a seemingly viable short-term investment, despite it's incredible price (nearly $480 at it's peak last week).  I think that this downturn will be the end, though, simply because it has had such massive gain over such a short period, it's just too volatile.
