Last night in #2600 there was talk about illwill, who frequents the channel and is going to jail soon for selling the source code to Windows.  This was a big enough story that it has been <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&q=illwill&btnG=Search+News">in the news</a> recently, yet there wasn't a Wikipedia article for him.  I created a quick one (only a couple of sentances and a link) yet within the hour it had gone from a simple stub linking to <a href="http://illmob.org">his site</a>, to a full-fledged article.  Today, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Genovese&action=history">nearly 20 edits</a>.

Have I said how much I love Wikipedia?
