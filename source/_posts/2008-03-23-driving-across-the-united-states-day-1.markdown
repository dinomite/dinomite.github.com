I'm moving from [The Commonwealth of Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia) to [The California Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley).  As an adventure, and a means to get my car to the West Coast, I'm driving across the country with my dad in my [M3](http://gallery.dinomite.net/v/Cars/BMW_M3/).  Because of the nature of the car, we're avoiding the snowy highways through the middle of the country and following a generally southern route.

The first day took us through southwestern Virginia and into Tennessee, ending at Jackson, TN, about 100 miles from Memphis.  There isn't much to speak of in this are, save the fairly constant expanse of [Appalachia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia) that I'm used too.  Lots of [deciduous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous) trees, rolling hills and [blue mountains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains).

One good part of the day was stopping at a [barbecue shack](http://www.hogheavenbbq.com/) near [Vanderbilt University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University) in Nashville.
