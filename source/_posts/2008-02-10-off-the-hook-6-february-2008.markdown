This is the synopsis of [Off The Hook](http://www.2600.com/offthehook) that aired on [6 February 2008](http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0208.html).

It's a fund raising week at [WBAI](http://www.wbai.org), so [Off The Hook](http://www.2600.com/offthehook) is a little bit light on content, but they are big on giving you stuff for donating to the station.  Be sure to tune in live next week because they often extend the fund raisers, so you might be able to pledge next week for different stuff.  The premiums for this show are:

<ul>
<li>$25 - Off The Hook t-shirt</li>
<li>$40 - DMCA coffee mugs; one white on black, one black on white; for coffee only</li>
<li>$75 - 2600 zippered hoodie; "2600" on front, "hacker" on back</li>
<li>$125 - Lifetime subscription to Off The Hook DVDs (nearly 1000 hours of OTH)</li>
</ul>

Emmanuel plays a clip from a November 1999 show and discussion of the upcoming [Year 2000 Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K).

Micro controllers that control municipal functions are brought up, in particular the [PDP-11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11)s (not micro controllers) that control the release of sewage into the [East River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River) according to lunar cycles, which influence tides.
