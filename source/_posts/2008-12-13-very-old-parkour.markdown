This video clip from a 1977 film [Gizmo!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074573/) shows a 1930s newsreel clip of a man doing Parkour moves, well before such a thing had a name or community.  It's incredible to see exactly the same movements being performed 75 years before I had ever imaged doing them.  About 20 seconds in he does a wall-run top-out in the exact same fashion I've seen numerous people do on the high box at [Primal](http://www.primal-fitness.com/).  Neat.
