Since I have access to a Closed Course and a Professional Driver, I recently did a study of my M3's gas mileage at different speeds.  Since all cars are geared differently and exhibit vastly different aerodynamics, this won't hold much water (gas?) for any other vehicle.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td> Average speed </td>
        <td> Miles per Gallon </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;city&lt;</td>
        <td>22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>55 MPH</td>
        <td>32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>75 MPH</td>
        <td>26</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>90 MPH</td>
        <td>24</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>105 MPH</td>
        <td>22</td>
    </tr>
</table>
