Bombay changed it's name to [Mumbai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) more than 10 years ago yet news stories concerning the city on the Western coast of India usually still reference the name under British rule.  Surely this most populous city in the country and one of the largest in the world has enough cachet that we can all recognize it's name without being prompted by the past.  The Indians are already well on their way to being an econmic powerhouse after all and Mumbai is the center of this emerging market.
