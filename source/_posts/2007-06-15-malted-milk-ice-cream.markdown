A Google search for 'malted milk ice cream' only turns up a single recipe, that from [A Perfect Scoop](http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments/dp/1580088082/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-8039568-6832620?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181954898&sr=8-1).  I used that as the basis for my ice cream but only very loosely.  I've been cooking long enough what changes can be made to a recipe without screwing it up completely and so took the liberty of omitting the eggs.  I usually make ice cream without eggs mainly because I'm lazy and if you use eggs you have heat your mixture to cook them.  Also, without eggs ice cream is considerably healthier, containing much less fat and cholesterol.  Finally, ice cream made with eggs is technically a custard.  That final stipulation is the one I pull out when I don't want people to think I'm lazy.  My recipe is as follows:

<pre>
1.5 cups half & half
1.5 cups whole milk
1 cup malted milk
1/2 cup skim milk powder
1/2 cup sugar
1.5 teaspoons vanilla
</pre>

I use more vanilla and malted milk because I really like those flavors.  The amount of vanilla is perfect, but if you're not into the malt as much, you should first ask yourself why you are making malted milk ice cream and then only use 1/2 or 2/3 of a cup.  I used whole milk and half & half in the quantities specified because I wanted 3 cups of liquid total and that's how much half & half I had that needed to be used up.  The original recipe calls for cream, as many ice cream recipes do; this will certainly make a more luscious ice cream, but I've found whole milk + half & half to do a fine job.  My normal ratio is 1 cup half & half and 2 cups milk, which makes a very good ice cream with much less fat than cream-based ice cream.  I guess I really am making ice milk, but no matter, it's good stuff.
