[Pandora](http://pandora.com) is an internet radio service that also recommends new music, based upon what you tell it you like.  You simple give it some artists that you like and it will start playing songs by those artists, as well as artists that Pandora thinks are similar.  By giving each played track a thumbs-up or thumbs-down vote, Pandora learns what you like and tailors the 'stations' that you make to your taste, all the while showing you new music similar to what you have given a thumbs-up.  Check it out.
