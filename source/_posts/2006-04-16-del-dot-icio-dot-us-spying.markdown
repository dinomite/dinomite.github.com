I've been using [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) for some time now and I absolutely love it.  Not only can I access my bookmarks from any machine, it's easy for me to point people to collections of information that I've made and the organization is far superior to any other mothodology.  The public-ness of it brings up an interesting vulnerability, that of spying using del.icio.us.  Say that you know I write code for some software company and you have been hired to do industrial espionage for a competing firm; you can probably get a good idea of what I'm working on by the links that I grab.  Just a thought.
