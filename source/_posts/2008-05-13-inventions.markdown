If I had this kind of cash, I would be of the same opinion:

<blockquote>Myhrvoldâ€™s friends, like Myhrvold, seemed to be of the opinion that there is no downside to having a CAT scanner, especially if you can get it for twenty-nine hundred dollars.</blockquote>

The New Yorker has a [very interesting article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all) by Malcolm Gladwell, author of <em>[The Tipping Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point_%28book%29)</em> about [Intellectual Ventures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_Ventures), a company that does nothing but think up inventions.  They occasionally call sessions to which smart people are invited to talk and come up with patentable ideas, hand them to lawyers and then sell the patents.
