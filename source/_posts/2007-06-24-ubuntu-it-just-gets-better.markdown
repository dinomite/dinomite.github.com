Everyone has used Windows and at some point in time has tried to open up a file for which they didn't have a reader installed and got that dialog that offers to find a suitable program to view the file.  This dialog is worthless and has never lead anyone to finding the program that they need.

I created a spreadsheet on my office using Gnumeric the other day and brought it home to look at.  When I went to open it on my Feisty machine at home, I was greeted by the "Add/Remove Applications" application which offered to install Gnumeric Spreadsheet in order to open the file.  Very automatic, easy and very cool.  These are the sorts of things that really make Linux a great option for desktop users.
