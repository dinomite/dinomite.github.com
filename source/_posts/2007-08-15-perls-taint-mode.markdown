Perl is a great language for web programming and one of the features that makes it well suited is *Taint Mode*.  Perl's Taint Mode, quite simply, restricts what the programmer can do with variables that are acquired from user input.  If a programs relies on the user to specify something, it's a bad assumption to treat those values as safe for use in operations that may affect the outside world, such as opening files and using tainted values in `system()` calls.  Perl wont restrict you from using tainted values in innocuous things such as print statements but it does pass taintedness on to other variables that a tainted value touches.  Furthermore, modules such as DBI support recognizing taintedness of variable for safety.
