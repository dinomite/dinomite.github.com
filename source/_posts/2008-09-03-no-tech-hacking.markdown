While looking through the [audio](http://www.thelasthope.org/talks.html) from [the last hope](http://www.thelasthope.org), I stumbled across [Johnny Long](http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/)'s talk entitle [No-Tech Hacking](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2160824376898701015).  I saw this talk a couple of years ago at [ShmooCon](http://shmoocon.org/) and re-watched it via the above Google Video link and it's just as good as the first time.  Anyone interested in any sort of security should watch this talk because it's very interesting and very funny.
