[Sonic](http://www.sonicdrivein.com/index.jsp), the fast food chain self-proclaimed "America's Drive-in," which, I guess is true; it's the only drive in I know of this side of Oklahoma.  I'm not much for fast food, but I quite enjoy Sonic, probably only because of the novelty, as I only get it on my way to the Outer Banks, NC.  What confuses me is their advertising scheme.  The only place I've ever seen Sonic locations is in southern Virginia and beyond; indeed, the farthest north location on their website is in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Yet I see their television advertisments in D.C.  And in Rochester, fully 550 miles from Williamsburg.  Why do they advertise here, again?
