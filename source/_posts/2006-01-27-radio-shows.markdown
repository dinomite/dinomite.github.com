I listen to a lot handful of radio shows that feature call in segments including, <a href="http://2600.net">2600</a>'s <a href="http://2600.net/oth">Off The Hook</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/scifri/">TOTN: Science Friday</a>.  Allowing listeners to call in is something of a mixed blessing; you get to hear some interesting questions from different viewpoints than that of the host but said views are spoken by people who seem to be completely new to radio.  Callers seem to have never listend to the show in question - or any show, for that matter - nor do they exhibit knowledge of how to use a telephone.  More often than not, the caller is flabbergasted by the fact that can hear themselves from their mouth, the telephone and the radio simultaneously and proceed to blabber for some time questioning whether they really are on the air.  Thereafter, it is standard practice to have a long, drawn out explination of the problem/question, which could have been summed up in one sentance.  The caller shall then utterly mis-interpret the answer they were given and attempt to ask the same question, at which point the astute radio host cuts them off.

In conclusion, if you're going to call in to a radio show, think about what you are going to say, be prepared to say it when chosen and speak clearly.
