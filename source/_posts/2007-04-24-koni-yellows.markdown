I installed Koni Adjustable Sport shocks on my [M3](http://gallery.dinomite.net/v/Cars/BMW_M3/) a few months ago and before even driving the car I turned them to full stiff, like ya do.  Who want's anything but the most hardcore?  I finally got around to turning them down this past week (it's not like I go to the track all that often) and what a difference that makes!  Koni Yellows on full-soft are just like stock shocks and with a few turns under the hood, they become a good bit more go-kart like.
