I went skiing in Breckenridge, Colorado over winter break and while there I climbed above all of the lifts to the summit of Peak 8, 13,000 feet up.  I just added the <a href="http://gallery.dinomite.net/gallery/v/Skiing/Breckenridge+2006">pictures</a> to my gallery.  Here's a picture of the Baldy (that may just be the local name), though it's hard to convey just how high up the peaks are.

It's only a few hundred yard hike to the summit since they put in the Imperial Express lift, but because I'm from sea level, it's a strenuous hike.  It's quite steep, and involves kicking your toes into the packed snow to ascend because it's so steep.
