The other night, as I was just getting into bed, the fan on my GeForce 3 started making noise.  I know it was my GPU because it had been making noise on and off for the past couple of years and no, I hadn't replaced the fan.  Usually hitting the thing quited it down.  Unfortunately, such a barbaric solution was unsuccessful; in my wanting-to-sleep stupor, I just ripped the fan off of the stupid round stock heatsink and went back to bed, hoping the thing wouldn't overheat.  It's been three days since then and the thing is still working fine.
