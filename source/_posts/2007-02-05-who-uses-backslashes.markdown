My local NPR station, [WAMU](http://www.wamu.org) has been running an advertisement for IBM federal services and they mention the URL, which is spoken as "ibm.com backslash foo backslash bar," which won't work if you type it into your interweb browser.  Really, no one uses the Windows command line for anything real, who still thinks with backslashes?
