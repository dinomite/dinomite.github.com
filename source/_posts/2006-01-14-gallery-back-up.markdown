With the help of prayer and fasting, my gallery is back up at [gallery.dinomite.net](http://gallery.dinomite.net).  I really...don't understand how it's working; it required me including an alias in my Apache config that is used in the normal gallery configuration to make http://yoursite.com/gallery point to your gallery.  For my site, I have a seperate hostname, gallery.dinomite.net, for the gallery and as such, I want the root of it to be the gallery.  I don't really follow what's going on, but the voodoo was successful.
