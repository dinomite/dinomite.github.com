I recently got a bluetooth headset to use with my Motorola Razr and it works wonderfully, with the one drawback that having bluetooth enabled on the phone all the time reduces its battery life from 5-6 days standby, to 3-4.  I thought that turning bluetooth on and off was a pain, requiring navigating 6 menus deep to do so, until I saw the option for shortcuts in another configuration menu.  Shortcuts are easy to setup and make doing anything, including enabling or disabling bluetooth, a snap.

To setup a shortcut, you simply navigat to the menu option you want as a shortcut, in this case Settings > Connection > Bluetooth Link > Setup > Power.  Then, highlight 'on' and hold down the menu key (top middle button) until a popup asks you if you want to assign a shortcut.  Say yes, and then assign it the key '1', the default.  Do the same for 'off' in the bluetooth power menu, assigning it the key '2'.  Now, you can simply press the menu button and then 1 or 2 to turn bluetooth on or off.  Shortcuts can be altered from the Settings > Tools > Shortcuts menu.  I'm very happy that Motorola included the shortcuts feature, in particular because the Razr's interface is so blindingly slow.
