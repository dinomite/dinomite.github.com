* 1 lb. ground beef
* 1 beer (Labatt Blue was the stoutest thing we had on hand)
* 8oz. tomato paste
* Chili powder

Brown beef, drain fat.  Add beer and tomato paste, put in some chili powder, a couple of tablespoons perhaps.  Stir it up, let simmer for a few minutes.  Taste and add more chili powder until desired heat reached.  Let simmer for 2-4 hours; the flavors will meld and intensify.
