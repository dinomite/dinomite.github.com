If you ever talk to me in real life, you've undoubtedly heard me extol the virtues of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> (I just noticed that wikipaedia.org is owned by a squator, sad), the most wide reaching cache of information on the internet.  Well, I really dont' have anything particularly interesting to say, though today I learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream">The Scream</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhasa_Apso">Lhasa Apsos</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football">football</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump">heat pumps</a>.  Use Wikipedia, love it and if you do both, <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikimedia_needs_your_help">donate to wikipedia</a>; they've currently collected about $152k, which is a lot for an interweb organization.
