So, I'm pretty high in [self-efficacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy); I am very confident in my own abilities and my aptitude for learning new skills and information.  I look at things like [WRC](http://www.wrc.com) or [Formula 1](http://www.formula1.com) and think, "With some practice, I could definitely do that," which is my assesment of most things I come across.  Overconfident isn't a far off descriptor for me at times.  Occasionally, though, something comes along that totally shatters my belief in my own skills and simply leaves me in awe of someone's knowledge or talents, such as this video of a guy [performing a choreographed juggling routing with 5 balls](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6283096511750618839).  Seeing this video left me speechless and I have immense respect for that guy.  When you break it down, those are all moves that, with some practice, most people could be taught to do.  Stringing them together into a 5 minute routine choreographed to music without a single dropped ball is entirely another story.  Wow.

Edit: So apparently the guy is [Jason Garfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garfield), a professional juggler.  Given that juggling is his occupation, it's a lot more understandable; I'm still amazed at his skill.
