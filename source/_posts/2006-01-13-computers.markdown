**Tutorials**<br />
Information that I have written concerning computers and programming.

* [Darwin Kernel Compile](http://dinomite.net/computers/darwin-kernel-compile/) -  A how-to for compiling your own kernel under Mac OSX. Now you can snub off all of those people who say it's not a real OS unless you run a custom kernel. The reason you probably want to build your own Mac kernel is to enable MAC address spoofing, which I cover.
* [Nmap](http://dinomite.net/computers/nmap/) -  An introduction to portscanning and Nmap.
* [Filesystems](http://dinomite.net/computers/filesystems) -  I gave a seminar about filesystems for [CSH](http://www.csh.rit.edu) members. I became quite well versed in the low-level operation of most filesystems, EXT, UFS and Reiser in particular. I didn't realize until I was actually speaking to other people about filesystems how boring and monotonous they are.

**Code**<br />
Programs that I have written to solve specific little problems.

* [playlist.pl](http://dinomite.net/computers/playlist/) - A perl script to automatically turn an iTunes playlist into an mp3 directory.
* [portscan.pl](http://dinomite.net/wp-content/attic/portscan.txt) - A simple portscanner I wrote to learn Perl threads.
* [ws.pl](http://dinomite.net/wp-content/attic/ws.txt) - This script was, for the most part, originally in 2600 magazine. The printed version didn't work very well, my version is a lot faster and some other stuff that I don't remember. It's well commented, interesting to look at if you like networking.  It can find all webservers on the given subnet.
