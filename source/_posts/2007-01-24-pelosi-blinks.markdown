Check out how often Nancy Pelosi blinks - about once per second.  The president blinks at a more relaxed pace of once every 3-5 seconds and then there's Cheney, who's robot eyes never need to be refreshed.

If you watched the speech in high-def (wider and more detailed coverage!) then this was pretty obvious throughout the entire speech.

On a somewhat unrelated note, an NPR analyst described the war in Iraq as a [morass](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=morass&x=0&y=0), which I think is a very appropriate way to characterize the situation.
