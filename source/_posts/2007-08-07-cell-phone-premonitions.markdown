[The Freakonomics Blog](http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/) mentioned [a story](http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/newspaper/premium/printedition/Sunday/chi-cell_bdaug05,0,3857748.story?coll=chi-newslocalchicago-hed) about mobile phone providers knowing that something was happening near the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis due to hugely increased call volumes.  Later in the article there is also a mention of T-Mobile tracking the change in commuting patterns by the movement of cell phones.

Cell phone activity, just like any [side-channel attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack), can be exploited to learn a lot about a population.  There are certainly legal and privacy implications to such data being made public, but it would be amazing to look at from a research point of view.
