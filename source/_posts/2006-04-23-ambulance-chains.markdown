Ever drive behind an ambulance and notice the chains hanging from the rear axel?  I've always wondered what those were for and today listening to CarTalk they suggested to a guy who was complaining about being shocked by his car to use a ground strap or chains that would drag on the ground to...ground the car.  For ambulances, I would bet that being at ground potential is importand for their instruments (EKG?) or perhaps they just don't want to shock people.  Interesting.
