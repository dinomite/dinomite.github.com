I'm not really a fan of Jay Leno, but this quote about the whole Cheney shooting incident was very, very good; kudos to his writers.

"What a nightmare I had last night. I dreamed I was at a Washington party and I had to choose between Dick Cheney taking me on a hunting trip or Ted Kennedy driving me home." --Jay Leno

This came from a page with a list of [jokes made about Cheney](http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blcheneyquotes.htm) since back in the first term.  It also links to a couple of great clips from The Daily Show on shooting:

* [Downgrading the funniness because Whittington had a heart attack](http://movies.crooksandliars.com/com_tds_cheney_s.mov)
