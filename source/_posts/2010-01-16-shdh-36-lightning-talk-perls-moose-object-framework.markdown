I am about to give a talk at [Super Happy Dev House](http://superhappydevhouse.org/) 36 on [Moose](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/lib/Moose.pm), the object system for [Perl](http://perl.org).

I've put the slides for my talk up on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/dinomite/learning-moose-lightning).
