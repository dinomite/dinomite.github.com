It's not often that I praise any of the American auto manufacturers, least of all Chevrolet.  This isn't because I'm a European car fanboy or otherwise prejudiced against American cars but simply because they [churn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Five_Hundred) [out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Impala) [so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Aztek) [much](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Neon) [crap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile).  The chronic problem for manufacturers is that of  [least-common-deonminator, good-enough, penny-pinching engineering](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000321.html).

Though I'm a little bit behind the ball, Chevy [announced](http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/06/chevy-introduces-hhr-panel/) that they would be making a panel-van version of their retro-styled [HHR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_HHR) mini-SUV; this is the first good idea to come out of the C-shop in a long time.  Small businesses have needs to transfer things just like larger ones.  Plumbers and contractors have a reason to have a [full-size van](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Econoline), since they want to carry around a lot of tools and spare parts.  If you're not into construction, however, that's a bit much.  Beyond being more vehicle than you want to buy and getting terrible gas mileage, it's difficult to park and maneuver.  Sure, you can get a minivan for your small business but that leaves you little area to put logos and it's also too low, down below the windows.  Furthermore, a minivan is still often more space than is necessary.  So you could look at small hatchbacks such as the [Mazda 3]() or [Honda Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord) which are nice, but a little bit too small and still offer little space for advertising on the outside.

The HHR is just the right size; it's Goldilocks' preferred size, providing enough room to care somewhat bulky items (flowers, small catering gear, computers), a few cubbys for tools and some good space for plastering a logo on the outside.  I really think this is perfect for small business like florists, computer support and even someone like Charm City Cakes, who are often on Food Network transporting a wedding cake in a huge Econoline van.
