One of the well known problems with E36s is that the weak transmission mounts allow the transmission to shift slightly under load. When this happens, it becomes very easy to miss-shift and accidentally go into a lower gear then one intended. Doing so can cause a mechanical over-rev, destroying the engine. To rectify this problem, I bought UUC's Tranny Mount Enforcers.

**Parts required**

* Transmission Mounts

**Tools required**

* 16mm wrench/socket
* 13mm wrench/socket
* ramps or floor jack and jackstands
* Lock-Tite

The transmission mount install is easy. Get the car up on ramps or jackstands such that you can fit under it from the side (I did all the work from the driver's side) of the car. Once under the car, look at the tail shaft of the transmission and the bridge that goes across the transmission tunnel, supporting it. Support the tail of the transmission with your jack and then remove the bridge by undoing the four bolts that hold it onto the car as well as the two bolts that hold the mounts to the transmission. Now just replace the stock mounts that are on the bridge with your new ones and re-assemble the car.
