Yesterday at a Martin Luther King, Jr. day event, Hillary Clinton mades some egregious remarks, only one of which has drawn attention of the media.  Had she refrained from [comparing the current political state to a plantation](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/17/clinton.plantation/), the more politically important statement that she made would have come through loud and clear.  I say that her other major point was more important because it really sums up what many people think about the current administration, but few with a voice have had the courage to say,

> We have a culture of corruption, we have cronyism, we have incompetence

> I predict to you that this administration will go down in history as one of the worst that has ever governed our country.

I really wish this quote hadn't been so overshadowed by the remark about plantations, as she was right on the mark.  Sounds like the sort of thing a vice president would say.
