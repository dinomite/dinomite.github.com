Recently, I wanted to respond to <a href="http://twitter.com/peasleer/status/8136443388">a friend's tweet</a>
with a <a href="http://twitter.com/dinomite/status/8138332322">specific quote</a> from The Big Lebowski.  While there are a number of Big Lebowski scripts around
the internet, none of them provide markup to allow linking to sections of the script.  With the
help of some simple Perl, I created a version of the script with anchor tags throughout, making it
easy to point someone to a specific scene from the film.  <a href="http://dinomite.net/~dinomite/lebowski.html">Check it
out</a>.
