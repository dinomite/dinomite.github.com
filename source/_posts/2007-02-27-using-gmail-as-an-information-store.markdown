[This guy](http://www.micropersuasion.com) has a [very good tip](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/02/transform_gmail.html) on how to use Gmail to store arbitrary information.  I'm sure everyone has at sometime used some web-based email as a method of either moving data or otherwise storing something, by simply sending a message to yourself.  Well, he goes a step further and setup a way to automatically take emails sent to a specific sub address (`yourname+something@gmail.com`) and archive them away.  Simply setup a filter to take anything sent to `yourname+database@gmail.com`, apply the label 'database' and archive it.  When you come across something interesting on the internets, simply email it to `yourname+database@gmail.com` and it will skip your inbox but be held forevermore in Gmail's coffers.  To recall it later, just run a search for `label:database keywords` and google will search through your database.

Rubel goes a step further, using Google Toolbar's 'send to Gmail' function which takes the page you're currently looking at and pipes it to an email.  Just toss in your database address and send it to be stored.
