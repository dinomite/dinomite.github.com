    <div class="article-title-date">Dec 20, 2008</div>
    <p><a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/PeopleHistory/faculty/H_Shaiken.html">Harley Shaiken</a> had <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/18/pm_shaiken_commentary/">a piece on Marketplace</a> yesterday arguing that high labor costs, the sticking point for Senate Republicans concerning last week&rsquo;s bailout, are not a prime reason for the US auto maker&rsquo;s downfall.  I don&rsquo;t feel the need to break apart Shaiken&rsquo;s short argument, because he sums it up well in the final sentence, &ldquo;A superior product, high productivity and high wages pave the road to a healthy economy and a decent society.&rdquo;  We can all agree that workers in Detroit have high wages and the indigenous car manufacturers even have <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2008/06/harbour_report_detroit_3_erasi.html">good productivity</a>; but a superior product?  Not a chance.</p>

<p>The prime reason that Asian cars sell so well in the United States is because they have a superior product at nearly every price point when compared to the US companies.  Often features are not what makes domestic cars pale compared to their Korean &amp; Japanese counterparts; usually a general air of cheapness, from bad switchgear and low-grade plastic to unsorted suspension American cars are made to a much tighter budget.  The reason?  High labor costs at the plants of domestic auto makers, an average of $78 vs. $45 for non-union plants, force those car makers to make up for these costs elsewhere.  The only way to compensate for <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200812191552DOWJONESDJONLINE000977_FORTUNE5.htm">such a large disparity</a> in costs is for the US manufacturers to cut back on the amount of money put into their product, hence the low-quality cars.</p>

    <p>This video clip from a 1977 film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074573/">Gizmo!</a> shows a 1930s newsreel clip of a man doing Parkour moves, well before such a thing had a name or community.  It&rsquo;s incredible to see exactly the same movements being performed 75 years before I had ever imaged doing them.  About 20 seconds in he does a wall-run top-out in the exact same fashion I&rsquo;ve seen numerous people do on the high box at <a href="http://www.primal-fitness.com/">Primal</a>.  Neat.

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/11/03/voting-systems/">Voting Systems</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Nov  3, 2008</div>
    <p>On the eve of the election, I am thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system">voting systems</a> better than that which is currently employed in United States <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election">general elections</a>.</p>

<p>Among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-winner_voting_system">single-winner voting systems</a>, the most common is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">instant-runoff voting</a> and the simplest, making it the most reasonable choice as a replacement for the single-vote system that we currently use.  In an instant-runoff election, you fill out a ballot showing the order of preference for the candidates available.  When votes are tallied, your number one candidate is used to tally votes; if that candidate did not achieve a majority, then he is eliminated from the election and your second choice is taken.  This continues until a candidate has achieved a majority, thereby winning the election.</p>

<p>IRV allows for voters to cast a ballot for a candidate whom they truly believe in without feeling that they are throwing their vote away.  This solves the Ralph Nader problem from the 2000 election.  Nader was the prime choice for many Americans but his status as a third-party candidate meant that he had no chance of winning the election.  Many who might have wanted to vote for Nader instead voted for one of the two major-party candidates, because their vote would otherwise be wasted.  The few who did vote for Nader, were then blamed for Al Gore&rsquo;s loss of the election, since they most likely would have voted for the Democratic candidate were it not for the Green Party&rsquo;s presence.  Instant-runoff voting keeps third-party candidates from &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; votes from the major parties and makes third-parties viable, since voters can feel confident in voting for such candidates.</p>

<p>Another area of voting that is lacking in the United States is the security and integrity of the voting system.  There are endless reports of electronic voting machines losing votes, miscounting votes or being tampered with.  Creating a system that is both secure and verifiable while at the same time anonymous is not a trivial task but there is a group of people who deal with such odd logic puzzles: cryptographers.  After the fiasco of electronic voting machines in the 2004 election, many people spent time thinking about methods for secure, verifiable voting.  One of those was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, the R in RSA, who came up with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreeBallot">ThreeBallot</a> voting protocol.</p>

<p>The entire protocol is <a href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest/Rivest-TheThreeBallotVotingSystem.pdf">detailed in Rivest&rsquo;s paper</a>, but the gist of the system is that the voter fills out three ballots which are identical, save for a unique number identifying each.  Through some cryptographic logic magic, the ballots are marked such that any single ballot of the triplet does not divulge whom the voter cast their ballot for; because the ballot is unique, however, the voter is given a copy of one of the three to take home.  This receipt can later be checked against the ballots that are published so that the voter can verify that their choice was indeed counted.  Again, this publishing doesn&rsquo;t divulge information about whom they voted for, despite the fact that all of the information of the election is published, allowing anyone to perform a recount.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/10/06/a-good-day-for-rum/">A Good Day for Rum</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Oct  6, 2008</div>
    <p>The passage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.R._1424">H.R. 1424</a>) was a good thing for rum lovers:</p>

<blockquote>
SEC. 308. INCREASE IN LIMIT ON COVER OVER OF RUM EXCISE TAX TO PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.<br>
    (a) In General.&ndash;Paragraph (1) of section 7652(f) is amended by striking &ldquo;January 1, 2008&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;January 1, 2010&rdquo;.<br>
    (b) Effective Date.&ndash;The amendment made by this section shall apply to distilled spirits brought into the United States after December 31, 2007.
</blockquote>

<p>This change extends the limit on taxation of rum from Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands to a maximum of $13.50 per gallon.  Figuring that out was not an easy process, requiring looking from the bill&rsquo;s amendments, to to the original text thereof, and finally to the internal revenue code being referenced.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Oct  2, 2008</div>
    <p>It&rsquo;s always interesting to see what keywords debaters drop to get their points across.  To analyze tonight&rsquo;s debate between Biden &amp; Palin, I grabbed a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/?iref=mpstoryview">transcript from CNN</a> that was posted shortly after.  The transcript listed each speaker&rsquo;s name (Biden, Ifill or Palin), followed by their first sentence in that statement, with subsequent statements on new lines.  To make it easily <code>grep</code>able,  wrote a quick Perl script to join each speaker&rsquo;s full passages into a single line, beginning with their name.  With that done, it&rsquo;s trivial to search for words the candidates spoke.  <a href="http://dinomite.net/~dinomite/vpdebate.txt">The transcript is here</a>.</p>

<p>First up, &ldquo;change&rdquo; and &ldquo;hope&rdquo;, adages of the Obama campaign that McCain and Palin have picked up in recent weeks:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (change|hope): 17</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (change|hope): 25</span></p>

<p>Which presidential candidate got more mentions?<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (John|McCain): 72</span><br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (Barack|Obama): 45</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (John|McCain): 42</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (Barack|Obama): 24</span></p>

<p>Palin&rsquo;s state makes a lot of energy and high prices are on the mind of voters:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (energy): 9</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (energy): 29</span></p>

<p>Both talked a lot about the war:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (war|iraq|afghanistan): 51</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (war|iraq|afghanistan): 58</span></p>

<p>Palin cares about her family:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (family|child): 8</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (family|child): 15</span></p>

<p>Biden said &ldquo;clean coal&rdquo; a couple of times to Palin&rsquo;s one; they both mentioned &ldquo;coal&rdquo; in general more than that:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (coal): 7</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (coal): 2</span></p>

<p>The economy was a talking point:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (economy): 4</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (economy): 13</span></p>

<p>Only one of the candidates knows about deregulation of Wall Street in recent years:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (deregulation): 7</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (deregulation): 0</span></p>

<p>Wall Street or Main Street?<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (wall street): 3</span><br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (main street): 1</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (wall street): 5</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (main street): 2</span></p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/10/01/old-techno-album-reviews-dune-expedicion/">Old Techno Album Reviews: Dune - Expedicion</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Oct  1, 2008</div>
    <p>Best known for their eponymous debut album, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(German_band)">Dune</a> is a mid-90&rsquo;s techno outfit whose music incorporates many of the styles endemic to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">House</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music">Dance</a> at the time.  <strong>Expedicion</strong> is a good exploration of the style, featuring lots of fast beats throughout, a bit singing vocals and even some good-old meaningless talking throughout some tracks.  The entire album is also sprinkled with radio recordings including the classic NASA piece, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re go for auto-sequence start&rdquo; on the opening track <em>Rising</em>.</p>

<p>The album opens with my favorite track, <em>Million Miles from Home</em> which incorporates some speedy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-909">808</a> beats, broken by slow and emotive sections and all with a melodic vocal loop.  The track <em>In My Dreams</em> has a very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music">IDM</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music">drum and bass</a> style to it and is topped off by vocals that are a bit more odd, but appropriate.  <em>In The Air</em>, which is split into two disparate tracks, lends a somewhat trancey feel with it&rsquo;s lower tempo and slower progression.  The balance of the album, including <em>Hand in Hand</em>, <em>Rainbow to the Stars</em> and <em>Around the World</em> are almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hardcore">Happy Hardcore</a> anthems, save for their just-a-bit-too-slow tempos.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/09/26/splitting-mp3s-in-perl/">Splitting MP3s in Perl</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Sep 26, 2008</div>
    <p>I listen to some podcasts daily that have annoying messages in them that never change.  With a bit of research, I came across the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ilyaz/MP3-Splitter-0.04/Splitter.pm">MP3::Splitter</a> module on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> which has somewhat confusing documentation but provides a method <code>mp3split()</code> that pulls specified pieces of a file.  You provide <code>mp3split()</code> with the input MP3 filename, options as a hash and then any number of arrays that specify which portions of the MP3 to copy into new files.  The easiest syntax for specifying a portion is to pass the start position and the length of the desired chunk, both in seconds.  From the command line, I did this:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
perl -MMP3::Splitter -e "mp3split('foo.mp3', {}, [20,25], [95,600], [950,INF])"
</pre>

<p>which creates three new MP3 files, 01<em>foo.mp3, 02</em>foo.mp3 and 03_foo.mp3.  These can then be joined to create a new MP3:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
cat 01_foo.mp3 > new.mp3
cat 02_foo.mp3 >> new.mp3
cat 03_foo.mp3 >> new.mp3
</pre>

<p>Which will leave you with <code>new.mp3</code> that is a concatenation of the three pieces.  Using <code>cat</code> to join them means the resulting file will probably have some artifacts at the join points but that&rsquo;s not a problem for my use.  If it is, you can use something like <code>mp3join</code> to properly join the files.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/09/21/code-golf-saving-time/">Code Golf: Saving Time</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Sep 21, 2008</div>
    <p>After a new challenge, <a href="http://codegolf.com/saving-time">Saving Time</a> was posted a few weeks ago, I&rsquo;m finally getting to another round of <a href="http://codegolf.com/">Code Golf</a>.  As usual, my preferred language is Perl; don&rsquo;t read below if you don&rsquo;t want hints! </p>

<p>My first draft grabs the hour and minutes using capturing in a regex, then turns them both into positions on a twelve hour clockface.  The clock location is passed to the function <code>symbol</code> which, through use of some nasty nested ternaries, what should be printed at the passed position on the clock face. (470 characters):</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /(\d+):(\d+)/;
$H = $1 % 12;
$M = ($2 - ($2 % 5)) / 5;

$;=' ';

$z = $;x8 . symbol(0) . $/;
$z .= $;x4 . symbol(11) . $;x7 . symbol(1) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . symbol(10) . $;x13 . symbol(2) . $/.$/;
$z .= symbol(9) . $;x15 . symbol(3) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . symbol(8) . $;x13 . symbol(4) . $/.$/;
$z .= $;x4 . symbol(7) . $;x7 . symbol(5) . $/;
$z .= $;x8 . symbol(6);

print $z;

sub symbol {
    $_ = shift;
    $H==$_ ? ($H==$M ? 'x' : 'h') : ($M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o');
}
</pre>

<p>Perl provides the automatic variables <code>$`</code> and <code>$&#39;</code> (aka  <code>$PREMATCH</code> and <code>$POSTMATCH</code> with <code>use English</code>) which are, unsurprisingly, the portions of a scalar before and after what your regex matched.  I simplified the input regex by simply matching the colon and grabbing the hours &amp; minutes from <code>$`</code> and <code>$&#39;</code>.    shorten subroutine name (398 characters):</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /:/;
$H = $` % 12;
$M = int $'/5;

$;=' ';

$z = $;x8 . sy(0) . $/; 
$z .= $;x4 . sy(11) . $;x7 . sy(1) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . sy(10) . $;x13 . sy(2) . $/.$/;
$z .= sy(9) . $;x15 . sy(3) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . sy(8) . $;x13 . sy(4) . $/.$/;
$z .= $;x4 . sy(7) . $;x7 . sy(5) . $/;
$z .= $;x8 . sy(6);

print $z;

sub sy {
    $_ = shift;
    $H==$_ ? ($H==$M ? 'x' : 'h') : ($M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o');
}
</pre>

<p>I spun off the drawing of most lines into a single function, which takes the number of preceding spaces, the leftmost hour mark on the line, the number of interstitial spaces and the final hour mark on the line (380 characters):</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /:/;
$H = $` % 12;
$M = int $'/5;

$;=' ';

$z = $;x8 . sy(0) . $/; 
$z .= li(4,11,7,1) . $/;
$z .= li(1,10,13,2) . $/;
$z .= li(0,9,15,3) . $/;
$z .= li(1,8,13,4) . $/;
$z .= li(4,7,7,5);
$z .= $;x8 . sy(6);

print $z;

sub li {
    $;x$_[0] . sy($_[1]) . $;x$_[2] . sy($_[3]) . $/;
}   
sub sy {
    $_ = shift;
    $H==$_ ? ($H==$M ? 'x' : 'h') : ($M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o');
}
</pre>

<p>Before getting totally mucked up (311 characters):</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /:/;
$H = $` % 12;
$M = int $'/5;
print ' 'x8 . sy(0) . $/ . li(4,11,7,1) . $/ . li(1,10,13,2) . $/ . li(0,9,15,3) . $/ . li(1,8,13,4) . $/ . li(4,7,7,5) . ' 'x8 . sy(6);

sub li {' 'x$_[0] . sy($_[1]) . ' 'x$_[2] . sy($_[3]) . $/;}
sub sy {$_ = shift; $H==$_ ? $H==$M ? 'x' : 'h' : $M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o';}
</pre>

<p>My final effort which is 244 characters when concatenated onto a single line:</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<>=~/:/;
$H=$`%12;
$M=int $'/5;
sub li{' 'x$_[0].sy($_[1]).' 'x$_[2].sy($_[3]).$/}
sub sy{$_=shift;$H==$_?$H==$M?'x':'h':$M==$_?'m':'o'}
print ' 'x8 .sy(0).$/.li(4,11,7,1).$/.li(1,10,13,2).$/.li(0,9,15,3).$/.li(1,8,13,4).$/.li(4,7,7,5).' 'x8 .sy(6)

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/09/16/united-states-federal-lands/">United States Federal Lands</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Sep 16, 2008</div>
    <hr>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/zsafwan/2238940368/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2199/2238940368_6ed860e04d.jpg" class=right /></a></p>

<p>I gave this post a vague title because the control of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands">federal lands</a>, such as National Parks, National Memorials and National Forests, is a surprisingly complicated issue.  Tracts controlled by the federal government arise from disparate processes and are controlled by a number of different agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service.</p>

<h2>Agencies</h2>

<h3>National Park Service</h3>

<p>The most well-known federal land management agency is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service">National Park Service</a>, housed under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior">Department of the Interior</a>.  The NPS was created in 1916 to organize management of the fledgling system of parks that began with the designation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> in 1862.</p>

<h3>Bureau of Land Management</h3>

<p>Originally created in 1812 as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Land_Office">General Land Office</a> under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Treasury">Department of the Treasury</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burearu_of_Land_Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> became part of the Department of the Interior after merging with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Grazing_Service">United States Grazing Service</a>.  Unlike the National Park Service, the BLM does not exist as an agency purely to protect the lands that it controls; the BLM issues permits for grazing, logging and mineral collection on many of the lands that they control.</p>

<h3>U.S. Forest Service</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service">United States Forest Service</a> is responsible for the management of National Grasslands and National Forests, controlling access to grazing, logging and mineral collection on lands under their control in addition to allowing recreation on these lands.</p>

<h3>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> is the caretaker of the country&rsquo;s National Wildlife Refuges and National Fish Hatcheries.</p>

<h2>Lands</h2>

<h3>National Park</h3>

<p>Beginning with the creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone">Yellowstone</a> in 1862 by congress <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park">National Parks</a> are areas created by the legislative branch as natural preserves for recreational use by citizens of the country.  National Parks do not allow for logging, mineral extraction or any other exploitation of the land.  These lands are generally the most visited areas controlled by the federal government, receive the most funding for improvements to support visitors to the park and the most legislative attention.  National Parks are all manage under the National Park Service.</p>

<h3>National Monument</h3>

<p>As a DC native, the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._National_Monument">National Monument</a> evokes thoughts of man made symbol commemorating a person or event.  In terms of U.S. public lands, however, a national monument is a tract set aside by executive order without the approval of Congress.  The land for a national monument may be that which the federal government already controls or something that is given to the government by an individual or state.  The presidential power to create such lands was granted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquities_Act">Antiquities Act of 1906</a> signed by Theodore Roosevelt and first used to protect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Tower_National_Monument">Devil&rsquo;s Tower</a> in Northeastern Wyoming.  The intent of the act is to allow the president to afford protection to natural resources of the United States more quickly than an act of Congress is capable.  National monuments are intended to be less expansive than national parks, generally protecting a single natural feature.  Management of national monuments falls to either the National Park Service or the Bureau of Land Management.</p>

<h3>National Memorial</h3>

<p>Now this is what should make me think of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Memorial">Lincoln</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Memorial">Jefferson</a> Memorials in Washington.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Memorial">National Memorials</a> are protected areas established by the legislative branch to commemorate a historic person or event.  Though most National Memorials are administered by the National Park Service, some, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_National_Memorial">Benjamin Franklin National Memorial</a> are overseen by another organization and considered an affiliated area of the NPS.</p>

<h3>National Wilderness Area</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wilderness_Preservation_System">National Wilderness Area</a>  is defined within land that is already under federal control by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness_Act">Wilderness Act of 1964</a> as an area in which commercial activities are forbidden and human activity is limited to non-motorized recreation and non-invasive activities such as scientific study.  NWAs exist under the cooperative purview of all four land management agencies, the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service.</p>

<h3>National Forest and Grassland</h3>

<p>Managed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service">Forest Service</a>, a division of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Forest">National Forests</a> are unlike their protected brethren in that commercial exploitation of their resources is allowed with permits given for grazing, logging and mineral extraction.  Lands administered by the Forest Service my also be licensed for commercial recreation such as ski resorts.  National Forests are created by executive order as granted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Revision_Act_of_1891">Land Revision Act of 1891</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Grassland">National Grasslands</a> by the <a href="http://www2.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode07/usc_sec_07_00001000----000-.html">Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act</a>.</p>

<h3>National Recreation Area</h3>

<p>Until 1963, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recreation_Area">National Recreation Areas</a> were created by executive order but a change in policy means that all Areas designated thereafter are by legislative action.  National Recreation Areas can be managed by the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management or the U.S. Forest Service.  NRAs are usually created to encourage water sports on lakes created by the damming of rivers.</p>

<h3>National Wildlife Refuge</h3>

<p>Originally defined by the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 a National Wildlife Refuges exist, unsurprisingly, as habitats for specific or groups of species.  They are created by congressional legislation and administrated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

<h3>National Seashore</h3>

<p>Usually controlled by the National Park Service, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_seashore">National Seashores</a> are protected areas that are similar to both NRA&rsquo;s and National Parks.  Most of the areas contained within a National Seashore is available for recreation, often including vehicular offroading trails.</p>

<h3>National Historical Park</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historical_Park">National Historical Parks</a> or National Historic Sites are historically significant structures or areas governed by the National Park Service.  These areas were at one time declared by the Secretary of the Interior, but in modern times by acts of congress.</p>

<h3>Parkway</h3>

<p>Parkways are roads controlled by the National Park Service and are often scenic roads through federally controlled lands, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Parkway">Blue Ridge</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Creek_and_Potomac_Parkway">Rock Creek</a> parkways.  Others, such as a significant portion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore-Washington_Parkway">Baltimore-Washington Parkway</a>, are not maintained by the NPS but state and local agencies instead.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/09/11/rick-ross-financial-success/">Rick Ross' Financial Success</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Sep 11, 2008</div>
    <p>Since he was <a href="#">mentioned on The Daily Show</a> a few weeks ago, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_(rapper)">Rick Ross</a> has quickly become my favorite rapper.  The king of repetition, Ross hails from Miami and makes much of his activities trafficking drugs despite <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0721081rickross1.html">allegations that he worked for the man</a> during part of his life.  Like many rappers, Rick Ross talks a lot about his expensive cars and I noticed a trend in the vehicles of which he spoke.</p>

<p><a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/7series.jpg"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/7series-300x172.jpg" alt="" title="BMW 7 Series" width="300" height="172" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-341" /></a>
In his first album, Port of Miami, Ross&rsquo; makes a number of references to his white on white BMW 745i such as this line from the hit single <em>Hustlin&rsquo;</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
Who tha fuck you think ya fuckin with?  I&rsquo;m tha fuckin boss<br>
745 white on white, thats fuckin Ross
</blockquote>

<p>To be sure, any BMW 7 series is a fine car, but the 745i is the base model of the line.  Is Rick Ross a poor rapper?  Not too fast, in the song <em>White House</em>, he mentions a Rolls Royce Phantom:</p>

<blockquote>
we in the white house<br>
big phantom on the lawn getting wiped down
</blockquote>

<p>Is this song a fantasy about occupying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House">White House</a> proper, or is it simply hyperbole about his mansion, with a nod to cocaine usage and trade?  Given the previous mention of a 745i, I can only assume that the Phantom was but a fantasy for Rick Ross in 2006.</p>

<p><a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/maybach-116.jpg"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/maybach-116-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Maybach" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-347" /></a>
Times change.  In 2008, Rick Ross released the album <em>Trilla</em> and it sounds like he&rsquo;s had a significant upgrade.  The song <em>Luxury Tax</em>, makes specific mention of a 760, the top of the line BMW 7 Series:</p>

<blockquote>
Got my whole arm rocked.<br>
Keep the 760 double parked in the wrong spot.
</blockquote>

<p>The cover of the album also features the rapper in the back seat of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach_57_and_62">Maybach</a>, the sole car from the eponymous ultra-luxury brand owned by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes">Mercedes</a>.  The album also includes a song <em>Maybach Music</em>, Ross says that he has 20 whips, one of which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati">Maserati</a>.</p>
