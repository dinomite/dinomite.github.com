    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  8, 2008</div>
    <p>John McCain&rsquo;s economic advisor, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, was on <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/01/30/econ_advisors_holtz_eakin/">Wednesday&rsquo;s Marketplace</a> discussing the senator&rsquo;s economic strategy for the country.  In the interview, Holtz-Eakin said this of McCain:</p>

<blockquote>
He is a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution. He saw President Reagan cut taxes within the context of budget discipline and controls on spending.
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to say that McCain had seen the positive effects of Reagan&rsquo;s policies of lower taxes on the economy and that the senator supported such actions.</p>

<p>Excuse me?  Are we really still bringing up Reagonomics?  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics">trickle-down economics</a> championed by the Reagan administration is a contentious issue and its effects on the general populace, like that of all economic matters, is debatable.  One thing that isn&rsquo;t debatable, however, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_by_U.S._presidential_terms">size of the federal debt</a>.  To put it quite frankly: Republicans want to cut taxes and spend like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.  Ideally such a policy should be a boon to the economy and yet there&rsquo;s no clear evidence for that being the case.  What such strategies do affect are programs like Social Security; the money for tax cuts has to come from somewhere and more often than not it is by marginalizing other Federal programs.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t particularly care for Social Security but the fact of the matter is I pay into it and I want to get my money&rsquo;s worth.  As it stands, I may never see the 6% of my pay that goes toward the troubled fund.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  4, 2008</div>
    <p>In attendance: Emmanuel, Bernie S, Mike, Redbird and Not Kevin.</p>

<p>Bernie mentions that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System">analog cell phone service (AMPS)</a> will be shut off during the week of February 18th.</p>

<p>The entire crew makes note of their significant lack of sports knowledge in light of the upcoming Superbowl.  Emmanuel shows a surprising amount of knowledge, though he condemns this knowledge wishing he could replace it with useful information in his head.</p>

<p>The show is on <a href="http://bloggasm.com/january-30th-is-international-delete-your-myspace-account-day">International Delete Your MySpace Account Day</a> and Emmanuel points to it as evidence of the power of blogging and wonders whether.  Redbird insists that Facebook is useful and MySpace is not, though he admits to possibly having a MySpace account.  He also brings up the <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/01/myspace_torrent">flaw in MySpace&rsquo;s private pictures</a>, which allowed pictures marked private to be viewed by anyone.  Emmanuel longs for an antonymous version of Facebook where people create lists of enemies and Bernie says that someone named &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; had an online death-pool but was arrested and the site taken down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hope.net">The Last Hope</a> will be July 18-20th and more information will be on the website.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.charter.com/Visitors/Home.aspx">Charter Communications</a> accidentally deleted messages for 14,000 email accounts and claims the data is completely irrecoverable leaving all very surprised that Charter didn&rsquo;t have backups for the data.  Redbird is impressed that Charter didn&rsquo;t simply blame the loss on hackers.</p>

<p>Also not caused by hackers is the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/01/27/2008-01-27_empire_state_building_car_zap_mystery.html">Bermuda triangle of car problems</a> around the Empire State building.  Purportedly connected to cars with keyless entry, including Emmanuel&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(automobile)">Smart Car</a>, a New York City towing company says that they have to move 10-15 cars in the neighborhood per day.  Usually, they claim, towing the car a few blocks away solves the problem.  Redbird notes that the radio transmitters on top of the building are powerful enough that they will interfere with all sorts of radio devices.</p>

<p>A woman was awarded <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/24/america/24sentence.php">nearly the maximum sentence for her crime</a> after making light of her victim&rsquo;s death on a prison phone.  Bernie said that when he was a guest in Federal prison all calls were recorded and there are no provisions for private calls, even with one&rsquo;s attorney.</p>

<p>Bernie brings up <a href="http://www.qwest.com">Qwest</a>&rsquo;s refusal to participate in the NSA&rsquo;s warrant-less wiretaps over the past few years but mentions that they lost numerous Federal contracts because of this decision.</p>

<p>Estonia and Russia are in a conflict over the movement of a World War 2 memorial in Estonia.  Apparently the Russia government was not involved in attacks against Estonian government and business websites rather it was a young Estonian angered by his government&rsquo;s decision on the memorial.</p>

<p>The group discusses <a href="www.partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology">Anonymous&rsquo; Project Chanology</a> whose attacks have been successful in bringing attention to the cult of <a href="http://xenu.net">Scientology</a>.  Bernie relates a story from when he worked as an offset printer.  The owner of the business for which he worked was a Scientologist who tried to convert Bernie who was fired from the job after not joining the crazies.</p>

<p>Though Google <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070125-230048.php">changed their algorithm</a> to reduce the incidence of Google Bombs, if you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=dangerous+cult&amp;btnG=Search">search for</a> &ldquo;<a href="http://www.scientology.org">dangerous cult</a>&rdquo; the first hit is the website of The Church of Scientology.  In other news, the cast of Off The Hook is often equipped with <a href="http://www.2600.com/offthehook">blank expression</a>s.</p>

<p>Jim is still recovering and is now in a nursing home.  His address is:
<blockquote>
Caton Park Nursing Home<br />
Attn: Jim Vichench<br />
1312 Caton Avenue, Rm. 312B<br />
Brooklyn, New York 11226<br />
</blockquote>
Bernie says that Jim can now read again but still has trouble writing.</p>

<p>A listener wrote in to say that he saw a <code>robots.txt</code> which made mention of significant fines and lawsuits for people using automated methods of grabbing websites.  The consensus is that one couldn&rsquo;t get sued for using <code>wget</code>, but given the <a href="www.circleid.com/posts/811611_david_ritz_court_spam/">zone transfer decision</a> made recently, care should be used when using automated tools to grab websites.</p>

<p>Apparently OTH has a bunch of 80+ year old listeners.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 31, 2008</div>
    <p>I have a <a href="http://www.keyovation.com/c-2-ergonomic-keyboards.aspx">non-Apple keyboard</a> that doesn&rsquo;t have volume buttons of any kind, yet I find the ability to change the volume from the keyboard incredibly convenient.  System Properties&rsquo; built-in keyboard shortcut manager doesn&rsquo;t support global shortcuts (I want to be able to change volume no matter what application is active), so I went in search of a solution and found <a href="http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php">Spark</a>, which fits the bill nicely.  Coupled with a few <a href="http://bbs.applescript.net/viewtopic.php?pid=72265">Applescript scripts</a>, I&rsquo;ve got volume control tied to some function keys.</p>

<p>For those who need help with Applescript, simply open Script Editor (Applications &gt; Applescript &gt; Script Editor) where you can paste in those scripts to test them.  Alternatively, just save each one (minus the function definition) into files ending with &ldquo;.scpt&rdquo; and they will then open with Script Editor.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 31, 2008</div>
    <p>Anyone who has used X Windows enough, has certainly experienced the wondrous ability to move windows with alt + left click and resize them with alt + right click.  I quickly missed this ability after switching from a Linux machine at home to one running Mac OS X.  Luckily, like every small annoyance in Aqua, this one can be fixed with a small utility called <a href="http://coderage-software.com/zooom/demos/demos.html">Zooom</a>, which allows you to set key bindings for resizing and moving windows.  Additionally, Zooom can provide magnetism to screen edges and the menu bar.  It&rsquo;s free for 30 days and then $15.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/01/30/ignoring-florida-and-michigan-voters/">Ignoring Florida and Michigan Voters</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 30, 2008</div>
    <p>Though I think the DNC&rsquo;s goal of halting the ever-earlier progression of primaries is a righteous one, their execution of it is royally stupid.  By stripping Florida and Michigan of their delegates, thereby marginalizing the voters in those states the DNC has made campaigning in the states during primary season worth very little.  Indeed the democratic front runners all signed a pledge not to campaign in Florida in order to further shun the state for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18783378/">moving it&rsquo;s primary election earlier</a>.  The candidates are missing a vital opportunity to court Florida voters and bring them to the democratic party.  Sure, the nominee isn&rsquo;t decided yet, but we know who the possibilities are; shouldn&rsquo;t they be allowed to endear voters toward themselves?</p>

<p>As I said above, I do agree with the DNC goal of ceasing the one-up-manship that states are participating in, each trying to get their primary to be the first.  Super Tuesday this year is during the first week in February, the same week that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary#Winners_and_runners-up">the New Hampshire primary</a> was held in 2000.  Primary season will be all but complete in 2008 at the time it was just beginning only 2 elections ago.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/01/29/drum-major-institute-on-the-2008-state-of-the-union/">Drum Major Institute on the 2008 State of The Union</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 29, 2008</div>
    <p>Searching for some numbers to go along with Bush&rsquo;s final State of The Union address, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/library/article.php?ID=6675">this piece</a> by the oddly-named <a href="http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/library/article.php?ID=6675">Drum Major Institute</a>.  Their rebuttal covers the main points that were made presented with quotes from the speech alongside the DMI&rsquo;s official riposte sound byte.  Furthermore, the institute provides more in depth dissection of their position with (select) numbers to back up their retort.  Being a biased response, the commentary doesn&rsquo;t fully explore each issue, but that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s anything like <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1067">Fox News biased</a>.</p>

<p>The specific statistic I was searching for after hearing <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2101185">Robert Siegel</a> or <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1934700">David Welna</a> (I&rsquo;m so old-school I listened to it on the radio) mention that Bush&rsquo;s $18b cut of so-called useless programs from the federal budget was really a small change.  Indeed it is, as the proposed federal budget is $2.9 trillion for 2008, making Bush vaunted cuts a mere .6%.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/01/26/off-the-hook-23-january-2008/">Off The Hook - 23 January 2008</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 26, 2008</div>
    <p>The Data Loss of the Week award goes to <a href="http://www.gemoney.com">GE Money</a>, the credit card processing company used by <a href="http://www.jcpenny.com">JC Penny</a> department stores, who lost information on 650,000 customers including social security numbers for 150,000 of those.  The information was on a backup tape that was stored in a warehouse of <a href="http://www.ironmountain.com/index.asp">Iron Mountain</a> and went missing last October.  Of course, the company reported that there was no reason to suspect the data was stolen nor used fraudulently.  Mike mentions that, like most lost data incidents, a year of free credit monitoring will probably be given to the victims.  Emmanuel wonders whether those given the credit monitoring service will be automatically billed for it after the year is up.  Bernie S. uses a service after <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004100554_btdatabreaches31.html">TD Ameritrade lost his information</a> 3 months ago.  He said that they did not take any billing information, so wouldn&rsquo;t be able to charge him without his knowledge and likens it to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Do_Not_Call_Registry">Do Not Call List</a>, which is often abused by unscrupulous telemarketers.  The <a href="http://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Center</a> says that there was a 6 fold increase in the number of compromised records last year, a total of 125 million in 2007.</p>

<p>Emmanuel goes on a long tirade about his Verizon land-line phone bill, complaining about the charge for &ldquo;Verizon Freedom Essentials,&rdquo; which includes call-waiting ID, and anonymous call rejection, which is free.  The big complaint is something marked as &ldquo;discounted telecommunications service&rdquo; which, though it sounds like a good and normal thing, is actually the name of a company, that charged him for directory assistance at a rate of $8.50 per instance.  In order to get the charge removed, Emmanuel says the best tactic is to claim that the line is connected to a fax machine and that there is no way he could have made a call.  A tangential discussion about the exorbitant cost and low quality of directory assistance leads Bernie to divulge his method of getting good advice for an area he knows little about: he simply calls a random number in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbering_plan">NPA</a> and prefix that he is looking for information about.  With a bit of social engineering, most people will recommend a business that suits your needs.</p>

<p>A North Dakota judge decided that <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/811611_david_ritz_court_spam/">performing a zone transfer is illegal</a> if you don&rsquo;t obtain authorization first.  Bernie likens it to what he was arrested for, possessing equipment for the modification of telecommunications instruments for the unauthorized access to telecommunications services.  His appeal was based upon the fact that the law didn&rsquo;t specify who would give authorization for such modifications.  Though a similar case, Mike clarifies that performing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone_transfer">zone transfer</a>, getting all of the host in a domain, is trivial, requiring no special equipment and only common software.  Furthermore, DNS servers can be easily setup  to deny zone transfer requests.  The same judge also said that compiling &lsquo;whois&rsquo; lookups without permission from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Solutions">Network Solutions</a> is also illegal.</p>

<p>The head of the European Union&rsquo;s privacy regulators declared that IP addresses should be treated as personal information.  Though Google and others maintain that an IP address only identifies a computer, the EU commissioner said that because most people use the same computers repeatedly, it was still personal information.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xenu.net">The Church of Scientology</a> was DDOSed  by &ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo; last week orchestrated as <a href="http://www.partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology">Project Chanology</a> as a coordinated attack against Scientology.  This is in response to a recent video of Tom Cruise which the Church of Scientology forced YouTube to take down.  <a href="http://gawker.com/5002269/the-cruise-indoctrination-video-scientology-tried-to-suppress">Gawker still has the video up</a>, a good example of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect</a>, which goes unmentioned on the show.</p>

<p>Time Warner has announced that it will <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9057739&amp;intsrc=news_ts_head">start using usage-based billing</a>, which Emmanuel likens as, &ldquo;people who use the internet more will pay more and people who use it less will pay the same.&rdquo;  Bernie notes that Time Warner and Comcast both kick people off of their &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; services if they cross a certain threshold of usage surmising that they don&rsquo;t publish the limit because it would conflict with the advertising of the service as unlimited.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/61271.html">Federal Energy Regulatory Commision</a> approved cyber-security standards to protect electrical utilities from attacks by hackers.  A group representing electricity generators, the <a href="http://www.eei.org">Edison Electric Institute</a> recommended the standards, &ldquo;following growing concerns about the security of utilities.&rdquo;  A senior CIA analyst, Tom Donahue, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20080119/tc_pcworld/141564;_ylt=ApT47f2sq03eNm7bFHH2Kg.DzdAF">is quoted as saying</a>, &ldquo;hackers literally turned out the lights in multiple cities after breaking into electrical utilities and demanding extortion payments before disrupting the power.&rdquo;  He refused to elaborate about where, when or how long the outages lasted only that they were outside the United States.  A video from last year, the Aurora Generator Test, blew this out of proportion last year showing <a href="http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2007/09/26/video-shows-simulated-hacker-attack-of-power-grid/">simulated hackers causing a generator to explode</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3804741.stm">A cocaine vaccine</a> was announced; Emmanuel and notkevin up the Orwellian implications such as parents giving it to their children which is an admission that their children might try cocaine in the future.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/01/24/regular-expressions-in-java/">Regular Expressions in Java</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 24, 2008</div>
    <p>Perl is my favorite language in part because of the fluidity with which regular expressions fit in.  To loop through a file grabbing content out of matching lines is absolutely trivial:</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
my @found;
for my $line (<infile>) {
    # Match lines and capture 'jazz' and everything that follows
    if ( /match this (jazz.*)$/ ) {
        # Save the captured stuff in an array
        push @found, $0;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Most other languages make such matching more difficult and Java is one of them.  Like in Python, regular expressions must first be compiled before they can be used for matching.  This multi-step process is significantly more cumbersome and if I haven&rsquo;t dealt with it for any length of time, I have to look up the procedure.  Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of the same matching from above, this time in Java:</p>

<pre class="brush: java;">
String regex = "match this (jazz.*)$";
Pattern myPattern = Pattern.compile( regex );

Vector<string> found = new Vector();
String line = null;
while ( (line = infile.readLine()) != null ) {
    Matcher myMatcher = myPattern.matcher( line );
    if ( myMatcher.find() ) {
        found.add( myMatcher.group(1) );
    }
}
</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of a hassle.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 22, 2008</div>
    <p>Top Gear did a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=MCyrDZmCijk">Man v. Machine segment</a> a few months ago pitting a Peugeot 207 against a couple of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour">traceurs</a>.  It was a very entertaining clip and showed some good parkour moves as well.  If you&rsquo;re interested in parkour, however, even more interesting is a short video on the site of the <a href="http://www.worldwidejam.tv/streetteam.1.parkour.html">Worldwide Jam street team</a> about the <a href="http://www.worldwidejam.tv/topgear.parkour.jam.html">making of the Top Gear segment</a>.  Unsurprisingly, each shot was done separately, some of them with some stunt assistance such as mats.</p>
