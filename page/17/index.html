    <p>There are a number of Ska songs that mention foods or, in this case, a recipe.  The following is from Greenhouse&rsquo;s <em>Palabras</em>, which I have on the album <em>Skarmageddon 3</em> but, as I just found on Amazon, is on their own album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-World-Greenhouse/dp/B000006AUS/ref=pd_bbs_3/105-7333297-0074842?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1184553769&amp;sr=1-3">Tomorrow The World</a>.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jul 13, 2007</div>
    <p>After my mom had decided that her new car would be a BMW 535i, I proposed to my parents that they might like to check out BMW&rsquo;s European Delivery program.  Through ED, you work with a US dealer to buy the car and get a 7% price break having to do with taxes and legal mumbo jumbo; it works out to be a good way to subsidize a vacation to Europe.  My parents asked if I&rsquo;d be interested in coming along and so we planned a trip centered, in my mind, around the Formula 1 race in Magny-Cours and visiting the Nurburgring.</p>

<p>We arrived in Munich in the morning and went outside to get a taxi to the BMW European Delivery center.  Outside was a lineup of cream-colored cars, mostly Mercedes E-class wagons and R-class MPVs.  A 220d E-class pulled up, we loaded our bags and proceeded towards Munich.  The drive along the motorway was fun because, in addition to reaching upwards of 160 Km/h, I saw numerous cars that I had previously only heard about on <em>Top Gear</em>.  At the European Delivery center, we were told that the car would take about 45 minutes to prepare.  We walked upstairs to the cafe and had some coffee and German snacks.  This will be the only time that the word &ldquo;snacks&rdquo; will be what Americans understand to be a small or partial meal; throughout the rest of the trip, it seemed that what Germans call a snack most others would call a good lunch.  Also, in Germany, what looks to be a croissant probably has eggs and ham inside.  These items are tasty.</p>

<p>After waiting a spell, we walked around the lot outside checking out the numerous diesel and 1-series cars that never make it to the US.  We headed back inside to wait a bit more and after about an hour and a half someone approached with the papers to sign over the car.  He explained to us the insurance that came with it (which is all the coverage you need, it seems) and go over other paperwork.  We then headed to the garage to get a quick rundown of the car&rsquo;s features.  After hearing about how many horsepowers [sic] the car has, we loaded our luggage into the 5er&rsquo;s trunk, which is significantly larger than that of either of my parents&rsquo; current cars, a Volvo S80 and Acura TL.  Once loaded, we bid &ldquo;auf wiedersehen&rdquo; to the friendly Germans and my dad makes his way through the unnecessarily small garage door and we are on our way to driving the car, which had only 1 mile on the odometer, through Europe.</p>

<p>We headed towards the Bavarian Alps where we would spend our first night in a small town named Ettal, home to a magnificent monastery which, of course, brews the local beer.  After sitting down for a late lunch with a half-liter of the aforementioned beer we walked to the far end of town, which took all of 5 minutes.  We hopped back into the car at that point and took a short drive to neighboring towns to explore a few churches and pick up some bottled water.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/07/09/peanut-butter-ice-cream/">Peanut Butter Ice Cream</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jul  9, 2007</div>
    <p>I got an <a href="http://www.cuisinart.com/catalog/product.php?product_id=313&amp;item_id=422&amp;cat_id=10">automatic ice cream machine</a> as a graduation gift recently and, because it&rsquo;s so easy, I&rsquo;ve been making tons of the stuff.  All thats involved is whipping together a mix, tossing it into the bucket and turning the dial; no need to fool with ice and because it&rsquo;s compressor-driven, you can create one batch right after the other without needing multiple frozen cores.  This allows me to easily create a number of slightly different mixes in order to find the best possible recipe for a superb ice cream.  Everyone loved a peanut butter flavored masterpiece I made a few weeks ago, so I figured that&rsquo;d be a good thing to start with.</p>

<p>I made three batches as follows; each batch contained a couple of tablespoons of vanilla in addition to that listed below:</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="10">
    <tr>
        <td><b>Peanut butter</b></td>
        <td><b>Sugar</b></td>
        <td><b>Light cream</b></td>
        <td><b>Skim milk</b></td>
        <td><b>Skim milk Powder</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&frac12; cup</td>
        <td>&frac14; cup</td>
        <td>&frac12; cup</td>
        <td>&frac12; cup</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&frac12; cup</td>
        <td>&frac14; cup</td>
        <td>&frac34; cup</td>
        <td>&frac34; cup</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&frac12; cup</td>
        <td>&frac14; cup</td>
        <td>&frac34; cup</td>
        <td>&frac34; cup</td>
        <td>&frac14; cup</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>All of these were very good.  The one with equal amounts of peanut butter and the two milk products was perhaps a little bit too much like eating gobs of peanut butter; the other two were much more like actual ice cream.  Skim milk powder, often an ingredient in ice cream recipes, is the only difference between the two with more milk and it had a small but beneficial effect.  I think it would work best to have a 2:1 ratio of total liquid milk (cream &amp; milk) to milk powder; &frac34; cup would be better than the &frac14; cup I used, in this case.  All of the ice creams were sweet enough, in my opinion, and perfectly creamy, due in large part to the fat of the peanut butter.  I tend to make fairly lean ice creams, so if you want something even more luscious, which seems to be how most ice cream recipes are written, go with whole milk instead of skim or use a heavier cream.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jun 26, 2007</div>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re trying to setup a proxy on Apache2 in Ubuntu Feisty, by default it disallows all access to any proxy URLs, which is good.  What isn&rsquo;t good, however, is that nowhere I could find mentioned that this could be found in the <code>proxy.conf</code> file located in <code>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled</code>.  I spent some time wondering why my Allow and Deny orders were being ignored until I looked at this file and found that it has the final say.  To allow access to your proxy, you must edit this file adding &lsquo;Allow&rsquo; orders within the <code>&lt;proxy *&gt;</code> block.  Simply use hostnames, IP addresses or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a> notation:</p>

<p><code><pre>
Allow from foo.com
Allow from 192.168.1.52
Allow from 10.1.0
Allow from 10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0
Allow from 192.168.0.0/16
</pre></code></p>

<p>For more detail, see the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_access.html"><code>mod_access</code> documentation</a>.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jun 25, 2007</div>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re using the Oracle apt repository (<code>deb http://oss.oracle.com/debian/ unstable main non-free</code>) with Ubuntu or a recent version of Debian and don&rsquo;t have their GPG key, you&rsquo;ll get the following error when running <code>apt-get update</code>:</p>

<p><code><pre>
W: GPG error: http://oss.oracle.com unstable Release: The following signatures couldn&#39;t be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 2E2BCDBCB38A8516
W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
</pre></code></p>

<p>To fix this, you need to add Oracle&rsquo;s key to apt, which is straightforward, if you can find the key.  After some searching, I found it at http://oss.oracle.com/el4/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle; to import this, run the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>
sudo wget http://oss.oracle.com/el4/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle -O- | sudo apt-key add -
</pre></code></p>

    <p>Everyone has used Windows and at some point in time has tried to open up a file for which they didn&rsquo;t have a reader installed and got that dialog that offers to find a suitable program to view the file.  This dialog is worthless and has never lead anyone to finding the program that they need.</p>

<p>I created a spreadsheet on my office using Gnumeric the other day and brought it home to look at.  When I went to open it on my Feisty machine at home, I was greeted by the &ldquo;Add/Remove Applications&rdquo; application which offered to install Gnumeric Spreadsheet in order to open the file.  Very automatic, easy and very cool.  These are the sorts of things that really make Linux a great option for desktop users.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jun 20, 2007</div>
    <p>Reading the <a href="http://bsd.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/19/1847206">Slashdot thread</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-BSD">PC-BSD</a> someone mentioned that there was a VMWare image pre-installed for playing around with it.  On the <a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/?p=download#vmware">download page</a>, in addition to being able to select mirrors, as one expects with a large file, there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalink">Metalink</a>.  Not to be confused with Oracle&rsquo;s worthless support website, Metalinks are files that describe methods for obtaining a file, in this case, HTTP and FTP locations where it is available and hashes for pieces of the file.  After first trying a couple of mirrors and only getting ~60Kb/s I grabbed the Metalink file and installed <a href="http://aria2.sourceforge.net/">Aria2</a>, a command-line Metalink downloader.  I simply pointed aria2 to the Metalink file (it can also take the URL of the Metalink) and it started downloading from 15 of the servers in the list simultaneously.  Needless to say, this resulted in a <em>much</em> faster download.  More information about Metalinks, including projects that employ them, can be found at the <a href="http://metalinker.org/">Metalink website</a>.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jun 17, 2007</div>
    <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used a Sun workstation, you know the joys of having a control key where most keyboards position the caps lock key.  If you&rsquo;re an experienced user of the Interweb, you know that there is nary an occasion that calls for the caps lock.  The fact that you have to hold down the shift key is a good moment to reconsider any yelling.  Though I don&rsquo;t use the console often, it is endlessly annoying to find that I don&rsquo;t have a <em>properly</em> positioned control key when I do.  I went searching for the right way to change the keyboard&rsquo;s layout, since I hadn&rsquo;t ever bothered to do it previously.  I found <a href="http://www.vollink.com/gary/deb_ctrlcaps.html">this</a> how-to by Gary Vollink which describes how to replace the worthless caps lock with the useful control key in all operating systems anyone ever uses.</p>

<p>For Ubuntu&rsquo;s console, it&rsquo;s a simple change in <code>/etc/console-setup/boottime.kmap.gz</code>, which can be edited directly with <code>vi</code>; no need to un-gzip it first.  Keycode 29 is the left control key and #58 is the caps lock.  If you want another control, just copy the contents of 29 to 58 and if, for some reason (lots of SQL?) you care to swap the two rather than be rid of caps lock entirely, simply swap the values after the equals signs.</p>

<p>In X, I had previously used Gnome&rsquo;s keyboard preferences to change the caps lock setting, but the above-mentioned howto showed that it could be done by adding the following option to the &lsquo;InputDevice&rsquo; section of one&rsquo;s <code>xorg.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>
Option      "XkbOptions"    "lv3:ralt_switch, ctrl:nocaps"

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/06/15/malted-milk-ice-cream/">Malted Milk Ice Cream</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jun 15, 2007</div>
    <p>A Google search for &lsquo;malted milk ice cream&rsquo; only turns up a single recipe, that from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments/dp/1580088082/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-8039568-6832620?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181954898&amp;sr=8-1">A Perfect Scoop</a>.  I used that as the basis for my ice cream but only very loosely.  I&rsquo;ve been cooking long enough what changes can be made to a recipe without screwing it up completely and so took the liberty of omitting the eggs.  I usually make ice cream without eggs mainly because I&rsquo;m lazy and if you use eggs you have heat your mixture to cook them.  Also, without eggs ice cream is considerably healthier, containing much less fat and cholesterol.  Finally, ice cream made with eggs is technically a custard.  That final stipulation is the one I pull out when I don&rsquo;t want people to think I&rsquo;m lazy.  My recipe is as follows:</p>

<pre>
1.5 cups half & half
1.5 cups whole milk
1 cup malted milk
1/2 cup skim milk powder
1/2 cup sugar
1.5 teaspoons vanilla
</pre>

<p>I use more vanilla and malted milk because I really like those flavors.  The amount of vanilla is perfect, but if you&rsquo;re not into the malt as much, you should first ask yourself why you are making malted milk ice cream and then only use &frac12; or 2/3 of a cup.  I used whole milk and half &amp; half in the quantities specified because I wanted 3 cups of liquid total and that&rsquo;s how much half &amp; half I had that needed to be used up.  The original recipe calls for cream, as many ice cream recipes do; this will certainly make a more luscious ice cream, but I&rsquo;ve found whole milk + half &amp; half to do a fine job.  My normal ratio is 1 cup half &amp; half and 2 cups milk, which makes a very good ice cream with much less fat than cream-based ice cream.  I guess I really am making ice milk, but no matter, it&rsquo;s good stuff.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/06/13/creating-encrypted-backups-with-gpg/">Creating Encrypted Backups with GPG</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jun 13, 2007</div>
    <p>With large hard drives becoming cheap and external enclosures easy to find, many people are finally beginning to perform backups of their data.  While an external drive is a good step that will mitigate the risk of the main drive&rsquo;s failure or an accidental deletion, it doesn&rsquo;t protect from the worse, albeit more rare risks of fire and theft.  I say this and now I&rsquo;m about to delve into some Linux jazz that doesn&rsquo;t apply to normal users.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I keep regular backups (I&rsquo;m actually lucky enough to have an offsite location to put them) but want to keep my most important data in another place as well and to do so, I occasionally burn a DVD with said data.  My only concern with this is that if I, say, leave it in my car now my potentially private data is even more susceptible to theft.  In order to make this a non-issue, I use the following command to create encrypted and gzipped tar archives:</p>

<p><code><pre>
tar -chf - foo/ | gzip - | gpg -e -r Drew &gt; foo.tar.gz.gpg
</code></pre></p>

<p>Quite simple, really.</p>
