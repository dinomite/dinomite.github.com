    <p>This probably isn't that interesting, but I'll may find it good to look back on at some point.  A simple picture of my desk while I'm working on a project on the laptop and the right screen (I just got the LCD for Christmas); you can also see the massive queue of books I needed to get through at that time.  That little plastic shelf almost broke.

    <p>My roomate and I have conversations in the apartment and rather than showing each other what we're looking at we usually just send links.  This produces interesting chat logs:</p>

    <p>Though I like his books, I don't often listen to <a href="http://shows.airamericaradio.com/alfrankenshow/">Al Franken's radio show</a>; the show makes him seem more like a balance for Rush Limbaugh.  That's really an overstatement, because Franken isn't a psychotic drug addict who wants to kill people on the other side of the line, but Republicans these day seem to fit into the moderate (John McCain) or extreme (Rush Limbaugh, Tom DeLay, Ann Coulter, etc.) bins with little in between making it hard to find an analog for Franken.  Back to the point, though, I listened to The Al Franken show today (Monday's show via Autocast; the word podcast is a misnomer) and he had a funny bit, featuring a parody song entitled <a href="http://shows.airamericaradio.com/alfrankenshow/node/4154">"Hang on Stevens"</a> admonishing the leftmost of the supreme court justices to not relinquish his seat on the bench until after the 2009 inauguration.</p>

<p>In other news, <a href="http://virtualthreads.blogspot.com">Virtual Threads</a> posted an article yesterday about understanding Linux memory usage which was featured on Slashdot and Digg.  Today, he posted an <a href="http://virtualthreads.blogspot.com/2006/02/hello-world.html">interesting map</a> of where his web hits came from.  Pretty cool to look at; I didn't realize there were so many technology inclined people in the central US.</p>

    <p>Last night in #2600 there was talk about illwill, who frequents the channel and is going to jail soon for selling the source code to Windows.  This was a big enough story that it has been <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=illwill&amp;btnG=Search+News">in the news</a> recently, yet there wasn't a Wikipedia article for him.  I created a quick one (only a couple of sentances and a link) yet within the hour it had gone from a simple stub linking to <a href="http://illmob.org">his site</a>, to a full-fledged article.  Today, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Genovese&amp;action=history">nearly 20 edits</a>.</p>

<p>Have I said how much I love Wikipedia?</p>

    <p>I listen to a lot handful of radio shows that feature call in segments including, <a href="http://2600.net">2600</a>'s <a href="http://2600.net/oth">Off The Hook</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/scifri/">TOTN: Science Friday</a>.  Allowing listeners to call in is something of a mixed blessing; you get to hear some interesting questions from different viewpoints than that of the host but said views are spoken by people who seem to be completely new to radio.  Callers seem to have never listend to the show in question - or any show, for that matter - nor do they exhibit knowledge of how to use a telephone.  More often than not, the caller is flabbergasted by the fact that can hear themselves from their mouth, the telephone and the radio simultaneously and proceed to blabber for some time questioning whether they really are on the air.  Thereafter, it is standard practice to have a long, drawn out explination of the problem/question, which could have been summed up in one sentance.  The caller shall then utterly mis-interpret the answer they were given and attempt to ask the same question, at which point the astute radio host cuts them off.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if you're going to call in to a radio show, think about what you are going to say, be prepared to say it when chosen and speak clearly.</p>

    <p>Like many people, since the day Google had it's IPO I was wishing that I could have gotten in on that action.  By the end of the month, when the stock continued to rise, I still sort of wished that I had bought some shortly after the IPO, but the thought of "man, $130 for a volatile internet stock? it can't keep rising," and yet, it has continued to rise steadily, until this week when rumors of Google being targeted by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">DOJ</a> surfaced and &lt;a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=goog&gt;GOOG&lt;/a&gt; dropped 8% in just two days.  The forever-climbing nature of Google's stock has made it a seemingly viable short-term investment, despite it's incredible price (nearly $480 at it's peak last week).  I think that this downturn will be the end, though, simply because it has had such massive gain over such a short period, it's just too volatile.</p>

    <p>Anyone who has used Unix or a derivative for long enough should know of crypt(3), the basic Unix hashing function.  Back In The Day, unices used crypt(3) for hashing passwords and It Was Good; computers were once slow enough that DES was an acceptable encryption algorithm even with a limit of 8 characters.  Since about the turn of the century (the latest one), any Unix worth it's salt (heh, crypto pun) offers other options for password encryption, most often MD5.  Furthermore, everything I've run into, until today, used MD5 passwords by default, though Debian Potato still offered to use crypt(3) and non-shadowed passwords (knowing that came in useful in a cracking competition my freshman year).</p>

<p>Getting to the point, I logged into a Solaris machine that I set up recently and typed the password wrong, but it let me in.  At first I was…quite scared.  I logged in again, carefully typing the root password and was granted access.  I recalled the crypt(3) function…I logged in, typing the first 8 characters carefully and garbage for the rest.  I got in.  Long story short, Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) still uses crypt(3) as the default password encryption.  It's a simple fix, you just change a line in <code>/etc/security/policy.conf</code>, but still sort of apalling none the less.</p>

    <p>I went skiing in Breckenridge, Colorado over winter break and while there I climbed above all of the lifts to the summit of Peak 8, 13,000 feet up.  I just added the <a href="http://gallery.dinomite.net/gallery/v/Skiing/Breckenridge+2006">pictures</a> to my gallery.  Here's a picture of the Baldy (that may just be the local name), though it's hard to convey just how high up the peaks are.

<p>It's only a few hundred yard hike to the summit since they put in the Imperial Express lift, but because I'm from sea level, it's a strenuous hike.  It's quite steep, and involves kicking your toes into the packed snow to ascend because it's so steep.</p>

    <p>The other night, as I was just getting into bed, the fan on my GeForce 3 started making noise.  I know it was my GPU because it had been making noise on and off for the past couple of years and no, I hadn't replaced the fan.  Usually hitting the thing quited it down.  Unfortunately, such a barbaric solution was unsuccessful; in my wanting-to-sleep stupor, I just ripped the fan off of the stupid round stock heatsink and went back to bed, hoping the thing wouldn't overheat.  It's been three days since then and the thing is still working fine.</p>
