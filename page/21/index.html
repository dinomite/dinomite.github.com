    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 28, 2007</div>
    <p>I just picked up <strong>The God Delusion</strong> by Richard Dawkins, a book which I&rsquo;m sure contains numerous interesting quotes.  The first chapter focuses on the undue respect afforded to religious beliefs.  Dawkins makes the point that, though people can openly argue about politics, economics and warfare, religion gets a pass.  Arguing about religion is a way to bring up undue hatred from anyone whose views differ.  In concluding the chapter he quotes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a> who said, &ldquo;We must respect the other fellow&rsquo;s religion, but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart.&rdquo;  A fitting summarization.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 26, 2007</div>
    <p>While reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale">the Scoville scale</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">my favorite website</a>, I noticed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_Sting_Pain_Index">Shmidt Sting Pain Index</a> was listed.  Like so often happens when browsing Wikipedia, this led me to read about other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_scale">pain indices</a>.  Other than the Wong-Baker scale shown at the top of the page, I didn&rsquo;t know that there were such defined scales.</p>

    <p>Check out how often Nancy Pelosi blinks - about once per second.  The president blinks at a more relaxed pace of once every 3-5 seconds and then there&rsquo;s Cheney, who&rsquo;s robot eyes never need to be refreshed.

If you watched the speech in high-def (wider and more detailed coverage!) then this was pretty obvious throughout the entire speech.</p>

<p>On a somewhat unrelated note, an NPR analyst described the war in Iraq as a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=morass&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">morass</a>, which I think is a very appropriate way to characterize the situation.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/01/24/bushs-new-health-care-plan/">Bush's New Health Care Plan</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 24, 2007</div>
    <p>In the State of the Union last night, Bush proposed a way to the way health care is taxed.  This announcement was something of a surprise &ndash; the first I heard of it was Monday morning.  It sounds sort of complicated, but once all laid out, it&rsquo;s fairly straightforward.  Currently, if you get health insurance from your employer you don&rsquo;t pay any tax on the cost of the plan.  Similarly, those who are self-employed can deduct the cost of their health insurance from their taxable income.  Anyone who pays their own health insurance outright, either because their employer doesn&rsquo;t offer it or they can&rsquo;t qualify for the plans that their employer offers, pay that expense after tax.</p>

<p>Under Bush&rsquo;s new plan, that last group would be allowed to deduct their health insurance cost.  The loss in tax revenue would come from a change to the taxation of those in the employer-paid insurance group; their insurance payments would be taxed if they exceed $15,000 for a family or $7,500 for an individual.  If your annual healthcare premiums are less than those limits, you would see no change and it would still be tax free.  The idea here is that this change covers the lost tax revenue while at the same time discouraging employers from offering overly-generous healthcare coverage and encourage the creation of low-cost plans that don&rsquo;t currently exist.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 18, 2007</div>
    <p>This week and last, news outlets have mentioned the <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/business/article/0,1426,MCA_440_5278441,00.html">rising price of tortillas</a> in Mexico.  It seems humorous on the surface but tortillas are the staple food of Mexico&rsquo;s poor and the 14% increase in prices for the commodity in the past year, as compared to the country&rsquo;s 4% inflation, is significant for many.  Tortillas have increased in price because the white corn from which they are made has similarly increased in value due in part to the increased demand for yellow corn that is used to make ethanol.</p>

<p>One of the authors of Freaknomics, Stephen Dubner, recently <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/01/10/will-the-high-price-of-oil-make-americans-skinnier/">mentioned in his blog</a> that these increase in corn prices stem from the high price of oil, which bolsters demand for ethanol.  Anyone who has read <em>The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dillema</em> knows that corn is the basis for nearly all industrially produced food in the United States.  Could Dubner be right that this oil prices could lead to less obese Americans through a convoluted chain of corn?</p>

    <p>I found the archives of the <a href="http://men.style.com/gq/fashion/styleguy">GQ Style Guy</a> today, which has answered numerous style questions I had.  It&rsquo;s also peppered with some serious wit:</p>

    <p>Generally the commercials shown on TV are targeted at the viewers of the channel or show in question.  Can anyone explain why I see UFC ads on FoodTV?  Is there really much overlap in their viewing demographics?</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 28, 2006</div>
    <p>My MythTV installation hasn&rsquo;t been working for a couple of weeks and I hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to fixing it until today; shows you how much TV matters to me when I&rsquo;m busy.  It was a really easy error to fix - simply a crashed table which was quick to diagnose and fix even though I hadn&rsquo;t ever encountered anything of the sort before.  For Google-searchers, the error from mythbackend was as follows:</p>

<p><code><pre>
&lt;snip&gt;
2006-11-28 17:38:35.805 DB Error (UpdateMatches):
Query was:
DELETE FROM program WHERE manualid = -1 OR  (manualid &lt;&gt; 0 AND -1 = -1)
Driver error was [2/145]:
QMYSQL3: Unable to execute query
Database error was:
Table &#39;./mythconverg/program&#39; is marked as crashed and should be repaired
&lt;/snip&gt;
</pre></code></p>

<p>To fix it, I simply had to login to the database, &lsquo;use mythconverg;&rsquo;, and issue the command &#39;repair table program;&rsquo;.  As noted below, make sure you see those semicolons.  Simple.</p>
