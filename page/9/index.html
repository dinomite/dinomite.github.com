<p>There's a small chain of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taquer%C3%ADa">taquerÃ­as</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">Bay Area</a> called TaquerÃ­a Pancho Villa.  At the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mateo,_California">San Mateo</a> location this evening I noticed a plaque commemorating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa">revolutionary general</a>.  I took picture of it and <a href="http://google.com/translate">translated</a> it when I got home:</p>

<p>In tribute to Pancho Villa (Doroteo Arango [ArÃ¡mbula, his full name])
To 119 years of his birth (San Juan River, Durango)
And 74 years of his death (Parral, Chihuaua)

    <p>I wanted to change the mirrors that CPAN was set to use because it seemed that the first one on the list wasn't responding.  I figured there must be a way to do this from the CPAN command line and indeed, a quick Google search <a href="http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/#s5">turned up a result</a>.  To do what I wanted, I first printed the current URL list, shifted off the offending host and then wrote the altered configuration to disk for next time</p>
<pre>
cpan&gt; o conf urllist
    urllist

    <p>The fifth day began with visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph_National_Monument">Petroglyph National Monument</a> just outside of Albuquerque, a city whose name I can now spell without looking it up.  While the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph">petroglpyhs</a> themselves are interesting, I found the best part of the park was the short hike to the top of one of the mesas to see an awesome view of Albuquerque and the surrounding landscape.  The lava rock fields that constitute the national monument were formed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_cone">cinder cones</a> that are atop the mesa.  The volcano's discharge covers much of the tops of the mesas and spills over the edge into the folded canyons where the images are carved.</p>

<p>Next up was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_Desert%2C_Arizona">Painted Desert</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_Forest_National_Park">Petrified Forest</a> in Arizona.  Though the petrified wood is quite striking, I found the painted desert to be more breathtaking.  The majority of the painted desert scenes are North of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_40">Interstate 40</a>, displaying a vivid array of color stripes across the canyon walls and cones.  I hadn't thought about the fact that the landscape is formed by wind and water erosion, but it's unsurprising that the wind in the entire area is constantly gusting.</p>

<p>After seeing the first park in Arizona, we headed toward Flagstaff and then North to the Grand Canyon.  We booked a room at a hotel just outside of the park and tried to drive in to get dinner at the main lodge but failed because they were completely full, which is probably the case nearly year round at the canyon.  In the few minutes we were walking around the lodge, however, we were within 10 feet of the rim, a fact we didn't realize until the next day upon seeing it in the light the next day.</p>

    <p><a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/vla-telescope.jpg" title="VLA Telescope"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/vla-telescope.jpg" alt="VLA Telescope" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>The fourth day started with a trip to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_National_Monument">White Sands National Monument</a> which is contained within the Army's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range">White Sands Missile Range</a>.  That point is important because when we arrived at the park around 8:30AM, we were told that the road in wouldn't open until 9:45 due to a missile test at the surrounding range.  Immediately upon entering the park, you are surrounded by brilliant white sand in the form of dunes covered with desert vegetation.  In short order, the vegetation subsides leaving nearly naked alabaster mounds surrounding the park road.  Even from atop the dunes, the only thing visible is the white sand and the mountains surrounding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tularosa_Basin">Tularosa Basin</a>.</p>

<p>After seeing White Sands, we drove back through Alamogordo North to Carrizozo, NM, West to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro,_New_Mexico">Socorro, NM</a> and further to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array">Very Large Array</a>.  The 25 meter radio telescopes at the VLA are individually huge and the array is something to behold even in the medium configuration that we saw, with only a few hundred meters between them.  What's more striking is to see the enormous size that the telescopes can be arranged as each of the railroad track arms is 25 kilometers long.  Thankfully, the VLA was courteous enough to put this in terms very easy for a Washingtonian to understand.</p>

<p><a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/vla-v-dc.jpg" title="VLA v. DC"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/vla-v-dc.jpg" alt="VLA v. DC" /></a></p>

<p>After seeing all of that, we headed to Albuquerque and had dinner at a standard city brewpub, <a href="http://www.kellysbrewpub.com/">Kelly's</a> near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico">the univeristy</a>.  Driving through the city was very nice, as the facades throughout town are all very entertaining to see.</p>

    <p>After a couple days of seeing next to nothing while driving through southwestern Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas, a day of <strong>absolutely</strong> nothing was on tap in the form of West Texas.  Our drive took us from Abilene through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater,_Texas">Sweetwater</a> to Big Spring where we ditched the interstate in favor of state highways.  Plentiful along this route are oil wells, pumps visible for as far as one can see.  There were also a number of drilling crews working to create new wells in the the most productive oil fields on the continent.  Additionally, Sweetwater is home to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm">largest wind generator</a> concentration in the Western hemisphere.  The hills in the town are home to innumerable multi-megawatt, 90+ meter diameter wind turbines.  Other than said hills, the highest thing around is a highway overpass, from which I took a few pictures.</p>

<p>After passing through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbs,_New_Mexico">Hobbs, NM</a>, we headed south-southeast toward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad,_New_Mexico">Carlsbad, NM</a> in order to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad_Caverns_National_Park">Carlsbad Cavern</a> near that town.  Though I had been to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luray_Caverns">Luray Caverns</a> as a kid, I remembered little of that cave.  No matter, as Carlsbad dwarfs its East-coast equivalent.  The size of the cavern, from the incredible entrance and the significant depth to the amazing underground area is astounding.  Most striking is the lighting, apparently designed by a Broadway theater technician.  If you are going through Arizona, Carlsbad Cavern is certainly something to stop and see.  Even outside of the cave, the drive through the canyon in the park and the resulting view from the mesa are worth the trip.</p>

    <p>The second day started with a trip through Memphis, TN to stop by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland">Graceland</a>, not because either of us particularly care about Elvis but it's a major stop for Americana, so you can't just drive by.  Surprisingly, even on Easter this landmark of tackiness was open and visitors could take a tour of the mansion, were they so inclined.  This was of little interest so, after a couple of pictures, we drove on to Arkansas with a stop to see the Mississippi river up close.  The river is incredibly wide as everyone has always heard and it was moving quite quickly due to recent rains.</p>

<p>In Arkansas, the terrain more or less continued getting a bit flatter as we moved on.  Little Rock isn't very big and the sparsely populated terrain continues all the way to Dallas except for the border town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit">Texarkana</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas/Fort_Worth_Metroplex">Dallas-Fort Worth</a> is as huge as one would expect, but we were on our way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene,_Texas">Abilene, TX</a> which held another pleasant gastronomic surprise.  In Abilene we had dinner at the <a href="http://www.lytlelandandcattle.com/">Lytle Land and Cattle Co.</a> which served undoubtedly the finest steak I have ever had.  I wouldn't have believed prior to this that a steak could be so good and it's surely due mostly to the quality of the local beef.  Texas is, unsurprisingly, a great place to get a steak and I am now inclined to try <a href="http://www.omahasteaks.com">Omaha Steaks</a> that you can get by mail.</p>

    <p>I'm moving from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia">The Commonwealth of Virginia</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">The California Republic</a>.  As an adventure, and a means to get my car to the West Coast, I'm driving across the country with my dad in my <a href="http://gallery.dinomite.net/v/Cars/BMW_M3/">M3</a>.  Because of the nature of the car, we're avoiding the snowy highways through the middle of the country and following a generally southern route.</p>

<p>The first day took us through southwestern Virginia and into Tennessee, ending at Jackson, TN, about 100 miles from Memphis.  There isn't much to speak of in this are, save the fairly constant expanse of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia">Appalachia</a> that I'm used too.

<p>In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Redbird, Not Kevin<br />
On the phone: Bernie S in Philadelphia</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/03/07/china.hackers/">Chinese hackers claim</a> to have gained access to worldwide sites including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> and are purportedly funded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China">that state's government</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/whistleblower-f.html">A computer security analyst</a> says that a major telecommunications carrier, perhaps Verizon Wireless, is in cahoots with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">FBI</a> after he was told not to enable any security on a circuit named "Quantico" by supervisors while performing a migration.  Such a lack of security gives the aforementioned circuit unfettered access to the carrier's entire network perhaps even uploading their own firmware to customers handsets.  Not Kevin points out that with GSM phones it is much easier for users to prevent such tampering with their phones, since customers have a choice and can easily change their carrier by changing the SIM card.  Bernie brings up the recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">CALEA</a> legislation that allows federal agencies to bypass the step of obtaining a warrant and providing it to the phone companies.  Furthermore, there is no logging of such taps making it impossible to account for wiretapping actions.</p>

<p>If you are suspicious of the number of mobile phones that someone has, notify the <a href="www.met.police.uk/campaigns/docs/postcard.pdf">London police at 0800789321</a> (PDF link).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.makezine.com/">MAKE Magazine</a> has <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/02/temporarily_blind_surveil.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">an article</a> for a method of blinding surveillance cameras.  It uses infrared LEDs to wash out the image by flooding the camera with infrared light that isn't visible to the naked eye but is picked up by most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device">CCD</a>s.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Municipal_Railway">Muni</a> drivers in San Francisco have had trouble with hooligans turning off the buses via an unlocked panel that hides a switch controlling the power for the entire bus.  Those on the show first heard about this vulnerability from Shapeshifter at least 4 years ago.  Bernie notes that the reason for the switches is to allow the power to be cut in an emergency, necessitating easy access to the switch.</p>

<p>A listener writes in about a service, <a href="http://www.earthcaller.com/index.php">EarthCaller</a> a browser-based VOIP service that works only with Internet Explorer.  The listener brings <a href="http://www.magicjacktv.com/1/index.asp">magicJack</a> mentioned on the program a while back that allows you to use a normal phone with VOIP via a Windows computer.  According to Not Kevin the <a href="http://wbai.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=358&amp;Itemid=42">Personal Computer Show</a> hosts have one of the devices and are unimpressed with its quality.</p>

<p>The same listener also advocates the use of the use of <a href="http://www.livesearch411.com/">800-call-411</a> rather than <a href="http://www.google.com/goog411/">GOOG411</a> because the former service doesn't mention whether or not they record the call.  Emmanuel first calls GOOG411 attempting to get the number for WBAI but gets some other business on Wall Street that sounds like Dubai.  The other service, 800-call-411 comes up with WBAI immediately without fuss, though it is unable to understand WBAI's telephone number.</p>

<p>"P" writes in asking for Jim's information:</p>

<p>Emmanuel says that a number of people have visited Jim and it has been well appreciated.</p>

<p>A Massachusetts listener brings up the cell phones for train conductors test that was mentioned on last weeks show applauding the fact that the municipality is at least testing the system.  The listener notes that this is better than a program in his commonwealth that equipped snowplows with GPS enable cell phones that turned out to be a complete failure.</p>

<p>Someone writes in to mention the new Mac OS X "virus" <a href="http://www.troika.uk.com/virus.htm">Newton</a>.  The letter also mentions <a href="http://www.computerdefense.org/2007/02/07/windows-xp-black-edition/">Windows XP Black Edition</a> and notes that it is very likely filled with malware.</p>

<p>Those in the studio and a listener mention that they haven't received their <a href="https://www.dtv2009.gov/">vouchers for digital to standard definition converter boxes</a>.</p>

<p>An amateur radio operator who also acts as a weather spotter says that hams perform a valuable public service during times of emergency.</p>

<p>A caller asks about HD radio, specifically whether special antennas are needed.  Not Kevin points out that all HD radios contain a decoder created by <a href="http://www.ibiquity.com/hd_radio">iBiquity</a> who has a patent on the technology.  He and Bernie both say that HD radio is of no higher quality and doesn't stand for High Definition, unlike new television technologies.</p>

<p>A question about cell phone repeaters comes from a caller and Bernie says that such systems <a href="http://www.repeaterstore.com/">are available</a>, though probably not economical.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror</a> made a very good point recently about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001037.html">browser shortcuts</a> that make browsing the web quicker because they reduce your dependence upon the mouse.  If you have any semblance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> caused by mouse usage, like mine is, then learning to maximize use of the keyboard in place of the mouse is paramount.  Following on this I will share a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_bookmark">smart bookmarks</a> that I have found to be indispensible since I started using them way back when <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/Main">Galeon</a> was my browser of choice and Firefox nÃ©e Phoenix wasn't even on the drawing board.</p>

<p>Smart bookmarks are bookmarks that you call with a keyword and an argument; the argument is shoved into the appropriate place within the bookmark and the resulting URL is then retrieved.  Their function is similar to the manner in which a fresh installation of Firefox will automatically bring up a Google search results page if you type something that isn't a URL into the address bar.  To create a smart bookmark in Firefox, first bookmark a page such as a Google Search results page in the normal fashion.</p>

<p><a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/google-foo.png" title="Google foo"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/google-foo.png" alt="Google foo" /></a></p>

<p>Then, open the "Organize Bookmarks" window by selecting it from the Bookmarks menu in Firefox.</p>

<p><a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/bookmarks.png" title="Organize Bookmarks"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/bookmarks.png" alt="Organize Bookmarks" /></a></p>

<p>Select "Properties" for the bookmark you created and enter something into the "Keyword" field; for Google, I use the letter "g".  To actually make it a smart bookmark, you need to tell your browser where the string you pass needs to end up by placing "%s" (a percent sign and an "s") in the appropriate place.  For my Google search bookmark, the resulting URL string is this: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%s&amp;btnG=Google+Search</p>

<p><a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/properties.png" title="Bookmark properties"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/properties.png" alt="Bookmark properties" /></a></p>

<p>What does this get you?  Well, now you can select the address bar (Apple+L in MacOS, Ctrl+L or Alt+D in Windows &amp; Linux) type "g foo" in order to search for "foo".  A lot of people use the search bar in Firefox to do just that already, but I find my method better because I have a ton of smart bookmarks for performing different searches.  Alongside that one for Google, I have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s">Wikipedia smart bookmark</a> (bookmark that link and add a keyword such as "w") which will take me directly to the Wikipedia article for the string I enter, a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%s%20site%3Aen.wikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Wikipedia search bookmark</a> that does a Google search of just Wikipedia ("ws") and a <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=%s">Google Finance search bookmark</a> ("gf").</p>

<p>Others that I use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a - <a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/102-2288794-0413724?url=search-alias%3daps&amp;field-keywords=%s&amp;go.x=0&amp;go.y=0&amp;go=go">Amazon</a></li>
<li>p - <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=%s&amp;searchon=names&amp;subword=1&amp;version=feisty&amp;release=all">Ubuntu package search</a></li>
<li>pc - <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=%s&amp;searchmode=searchfiles&amp;case=insensitive&amp;version=feisty&amp;arch=i386">Ubuntu package contents search</a></li>
<li>d - <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=%s&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Dictionary</a></li>
<li>t - <a href="http://thesaurus.reference.com/search?q=%s">Thesaurus</a></li>
<li>pd - <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/search.html?q=%s">Perldocs</a></li>
<li>pm - <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=%s&amp;mode=all">CPAN</a></li>
<li>y - <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=%s&amp;search=Search">YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>By far the ones that I use the most are those for Google and Wikipedia searching but having ultra-quick access to a thesaurus and dictionary greatly heightens my writing skill.

    <p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/113">Richard Dawkins'</a> talk from the 2002 <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED Talks</a> was recently posted on the web (ok, it was a year ago, but I just saw it) and it's a very good summary of his views militant atheism.  Now, Dawkins isn't advocating violence in support of atheism, unlike that done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Natan-Zada">so</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization">many</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism">religious</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_Islam">groups</a>, but rather supporting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_and_strong_atheism">strong atheism</a> and an end to religion.</p>

<blockquote>In my view, not only is science is corrosive to religion and religion is corrosive to science.  It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations we have within our grasp.  It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence.</blockquote>
