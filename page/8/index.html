    <p>I've heard of doing this for a long time, but always figured it'd be a huge jump to put my home directory into a revision control system.  For years I've scp'd files to a new machine when I moved in and when I made changes to my vimrc or ssh config, it was hell to propagate the changes to my other machines.  No more is this an issue, since I've commited my home directory.  The process is really quite trivial.</p>

<p>I first created a subversion repository on my Linux server.  A special machine isn't required, nor is root access; you just need somewhere that can be accessed with SSH from the intertubes.</p>

<pre>
~$ svnadmin create subversion
</pre>

<p>It's as easy as that.  To begin with, let's create the standard subversion directory structure.</p>

<pre>
~$ svn co file://$home/subversion/ foo
~/foo$ cd foo
~/foo$ mkdir homedir
~/foo$ svn add homedir
~/foo$ svn commit
~/foo$ cd ..
~$ rm -rf foo
</pre>

<p>So now we have a repository with a homedir directory in the root; this is where all of the files from your home directory will be checked into the repository.  To begin with, check out this new project into the root of your home directory.</p>

<pre>
~$ svn co file://$home/subversion/homedir .
</pre>

<p>Since there isn't anything in there, nothing will actually be checked out, but subversion will setup source control on <code>.</code>, your home directory.  So let's add something to it.  I have a <code>.vimrc</code> that ought to be identical across environments, so I'll check that and my <code>.vim</code> support directory into the repository</p>

<pre>
~$ svn add .vim*
A         .vimrc
A         .vim/colors/drew.vim
A         .vim/plugin/feraltogglecommentify.vim
~$ svn commit -m "adding stuff for the first time!"
</pre>

<p>Easy as that, all of my vim configuration files are in subversion.  Now for the awesome part.  Like I mentioned, I have a number of machines and, things like vim configuration files should be the same on all systems.  So now, I hop onto another machine and checkout the homedir project.  First I remove the existing <code>.vim*</code> files since they will be replaced with the repository versions.</p>

<pre>
Caligula:~$ rm -rf .vim*
Caligula:~$ svn co svn+ssh://dinomite.net/home/dinomite/subversion/homedir .
A    .vim
A    .vim/colors
A    .vim/colors/drew.vim
A    .vim/plugin
A    .vim/plugin/feraltogglecommentify.vim
Updated to revision 1.
</pre>

<p>Bam.  I've now got the exact same files on both machines.  If I'm at the office and find some flash vim option that I want to use, I simply add it to my <code>.vimrc</code>, check it in with <code>svn ci .vimrc</code> and when I <code>svn up</code> from the other machines, they'll get the new changes.  In reality, I keep a bunch of stuff in my homedir subversion repository: <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.screenrc</code>, <code>bin</code> directory and many others.  Subversion helps me keep all of my config files in sync across a number of different machines that I use on a daily basis; if you use more than one system with any frequency, I highly suggest checking in your home directory.</p>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document">Here-documents</a> are something that, once you know about them, you wonder how you ever got along without.  I first learned about here-docs in Python many years ago, but didn't know their proper name.  In Python, you define a here document with three single or double quotes:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">foo = """
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip 
ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu 
fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt 
mollit anim id est laborum.
"""</pre>

<p>One day, when I wanted to put some large blocks of text amongst code, I searched for a way to do this in Perl and found the syntax:</p>
<pre class="brush: perl;">my $foo =&lt;&lt; "EOF";
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et 
dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip 
ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu 
fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt 
mollit anim id est laborum.
EOF</pre>
<p>Note the use of quotes for the string-terminating sentinel (EOF, in this case, though it can be anything), which affects how the sting is interpreted.  Just like with other strings in Perl, double-quotes mean that variables and escapes will be interpreted whereas they are ignored in single-quoted strings.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">May 21, 2008</div>
    <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

    <p>Anyone who pays attention to the car world from an efficiency perspective has no doubt heard of the popularity that diesel engines have in Europe, but lack in the United States.  Diesels post significantly better distance per volume of fuel (miles per gallon, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong">furlongs</a> per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peck">peck</a>) than their gasoline counterparts.  I've always wondered how much of this disparity can be accounted for by diesel fuel's higher energy content.  A quick search turned up <a href="http://cta.ornl.gov/data/appendix_b.shtml">some statistics</a> (See table B-4) produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>'s <a href="http://cta.ornl.gov/cta/">Center for Transportation Analysis</a> which lists a gallon of diesel as containing 38.6 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule">MJ</a> per liter and gasoline as posesing 34.8 MJ/L.  Not that big of a difference; gasoline has 90% the energy content of diesel.</p>

<p>How is this reflected in the mileage of a real car?  Well, let's look at a Volkswagen Jetta which, until recently in the US, could be had with a 1.8 liter gasoline engine or a 1.9 liter diesel.  The gas engine gives 19 MPG city, 27 MPG highway for an EPA combined cycle of 22 MPG (<a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/20810.shtml">VW Jetta 1.8L gas</a>).  The diesel gets 28 MPG city, 39 MPG highway and 32 MPG combined (<a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/20812.shtml">VW Jetta 1.9L diesel</a>).  Working from the combined numbers, the diesel powerplant achieves 45% better mileage with fuel that contains just over 11% more energy content.  Not a bad deal at all.</p>

<p>The next question is how this all works out for the environment.  Historically, diesels have produced much more environmentally destructive exhaust containing more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide">NOx</a> and particulates.  Recently, however, diesel fuel in the United States has been switched to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low_sulfur_diesel">ultra-low sulfur variety</a> which, in turn, allows for particulate emission control technologies to be employed, reducing the airborne matter released by diesel engines.  Do the changes mean significantly cleaner emissions?  I'm not sure, because the stats are difficult to find.  Perhaps I'll find them later.</p>

<blockquote>Myhrvoldâ€™s friends, like Myhrvold, seemed to be of the opinion that there is no downside to having a CAT scanner, especially if you can get it for twenty-nine hundred dollars.</blockquote>

    <p>I don't recall how I came across the free <a href="http://www.proggyfonts.com/">Proggy font family</a> but I wanted to try them out on my Ubuntu workstation for use in Eclipse.

    <p>This is the synopsis of <a href="http://www.2600.com/offthehook">Off The Hook</a> that aired on <a href="http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0408.html">23 April 2008</a>.

The show is also available as a <a href="http://www.2600.com/news/view/article/2509">high-quality podcast</a>.</p>

<p>In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Redbird, Redhackt, Not Kevin, Lexicon, Mojo from California, Al &amp; Zach from North Carolina<br />
On the phone: Bernie S in Philadelphia</p>

<p>There wasn't a show last week because the show was pre-empted and there isn't one next week; WBAI is having a Report to the Listener show during OTH's time slot so listen in to hear about running a radio station.</p>

<p>Bernie S relates a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/court-rules-on-police-search/">Supreme Court decision</a> concerning a man who was <a href="http://www.scotuswiki.com/index.php?title=Virginia_v._Moore">stopped for a traffic violation</a>, arrested and, as part of the arrest, searched.  The crux of the issue is that the reason for which the man was stopped was not an arrest able offense, thereby making such detainment illegal.  As such, the state appeals court ruled that the pursuant search was also illegal a stance which was overturned by the United States Supreme Court, making the evidence collected during such a search admissible in court.  In the case of <em>Virginia v. Moore</em>, the inventory search performed after the illegal arrest found illegal drugs and the evidence was used to charge Moore with crimes pursuant to those findings.</p>

<p>Another case concerning searches performed by border patrol for people entering the United States.  The ruling made by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit">Ninth Circuit court</a> states that border patrol agents <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=mobile_and_wireless&amp;articleId=9079738&amp;taxonomyId=15&amp;intsrc=kc_top">need no suspicion</a> to search persons entering the country at a border control station.  Though the authority to search sans-probable cause has always been in place for border agents, the question of whether search laptops was also legal had been in question.  Though it is still legal to encrypt data and refuse to divulge the encryption key, the concern of law enforcement officers simply seizing the device as evidence and delaying its return for months or years is brought up.</p>

<p>Bernie S brought up a very interesting combination of the above mentioned decisions wherein a law enforcement officer can illegally arrest you, such as in <em>Virginia v. Moore</em>, they may then search you and subsequently charge crimes based upon what the search finds.</p>

<p>The Australian government is exploring the introduction of laws allowing employers to read all of their employee's company email in order to prevent cyber terrorism.  In the United States, this is already the case since the owner of the network and computers, the employer, is the de-facto owner of all data upon them.</p>

<p>A council in England has employed laws meant to fight terrorism to put families under surveillance in order to ferret out fraudulent school placement applications.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="http://www.policereview.com/public/jpr/index.html">Jane's Police Review</a>, London's metropolitan police department is <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=558597&amp;in_page_id=1770">planning to equip all of their officers</a> with microchips that will track their presence.</p>

<p>Israel says that Facebook is a threat to national security because soldiers and government employees post pictures of potentially classified material and equipment.  Redhackt commiserates the desire to post pictures of oneself with interesting military hardware.</p>

<p>This weeks data loss comes from a New York Presbyterrian hospital that lost 40,000 records of patient names and social security numbers.  Unsurprisingly, a spokeswoman fr the hospital says that there is nothing to show that the information has been misused.</p>

    <p>Having a purgatory for files that are on their way to deletion, such as the trash can in Mac OS or the recycle bin in Windows, is a great idea, for even the most careful users occasionally delete something only to find that they later need it.  Unfortunately, the two aforementioned implementations, as well as those in Gnome and KDE, only allow you to empty the trash all at once.  Much more useful is to have a timeout where files that are sent to the trash are automatically removed after a period of time.  I finally got around to implementing this myself in Mac OS by putting the following in my <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/mac/2001/12/14/terminal_one.html">crontab</a>:</p>

<pre>
0 5 * * * /usr/bin/find /Users/<username>/.Trash -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -mtime +14 -exec rm -rf {} \;


Every day at 0500 any item more than 14 days old is delete from the trash can.  To install it, read the linked article above or, if you know the command line, open a terminal, type `crontab -e`, paste the above (substituting your username) and save the file.

<strong>Edit:</strong> In the comments, Matt mentioned [Compost](http://www.fastforwardsw.com/compost/), a preference pane for OS X that provides the functionality I describe, but also the ability to limit the trash based upon size, and also manage the Trash on other volumes.  Neat!  It's $20, but definitely makes this process easier and understandable if you aren't a Unix person.

    <p>I learned something new in the world of Perl regular expressions today when I came across this line:</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
 my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = $string =~ /(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/;
</pre>

<p>The operative side of the line, <code>$string =~ /(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/</code> is a normal Perl regex binding statement - apply the regular expression <code>/(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/</code> to <code>$string</code>.  What's interesting is that the binding operator returns the things matched within the capturing parenthesis as an array, allowing you to assign them all at once, as demonstrated by the left hand side of that <code>=</code> expression.  The above statement does the same as the more verbose:</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
$string =~ /(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/;
my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = ($1, $2, $3);
</pre>

<p>Used in a scalar context along with the <code>/g</code> modifier, this is an easy way to count count occurences:</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
my $count = $string =~ m/\./g;
