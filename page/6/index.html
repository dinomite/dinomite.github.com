    <p>For the first time a few months ago I traveled by plane and brought lock picks in my carry on luggage.  After having read <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/267/2/">this article</a> about sneaking lock picks in the extension tubes of rolling luggage, I wondered what would really be required to just sneak picks through.  Though flying with lock picks isn't illegal the TSA agents are not known for their accurate knowledge of the rules concerning air travel.  I really wanted to have picks at my destination so that I could do a seminar on picking; I didn't want them to be taken away by an overzealous agent.</p>

<p>Lock picks don't have that much mass so I figured if I removed all of normal metal, including my belt, that I'd get through the metal detector OK with the picks in my pocket.  I tried this tactic on the trip to my destination and was successful.  After removing my belt, I just put my four picks &amp; three torque wrenches in my shirt pocket and waltzed through the metal detector to no notice of the TSA agent.  That was easy.</p>

<p>The return trip was equally uneventful, though I used a different method - I simply put my picks into the bag that I put through the X-ray.  Again, this was of no interest to the TSA; either they didn't notice or they know what picks are and that it's OK to carry them.  I'll assume the former.</p>

<p>Long story short: you can easily sneak a few picks through in your pocket if you have no other metal on your person.  Odds are you can get some through the X-ray machine without any hassle, as well.</p>

    <p>Why do so many people rave about Amazon's recommendation engine?  I bought a Canon 40D from Amazon only a few months ago, have looked at various accessories for that body, and have a Canon lens on my wishlist.  Why are they recommending me a Nikon battery?</p>

    <p>After years of being cold on the slopes, I think that I've finally gotten the gear to keep myself warm.  Through a high of 4 degrees Fahrenheit a few days ago and 16 degree snow with 20+ MPH winds today.  I'm sure someone will find this information useful.</p>

<p>I wear a helmet, so hats are out of the question.  Instead, I have an <a href="http://www.icebreaker.com/site/icebreaker_man_hats_gt220_quantum_balaclava.html">Icebreaker Quantum</a> balaclava; in addition to being quite warm, it stays so even when wetted with snow or breath.  As for tops, I wear an <a href="http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/mens/sports/snow-sports/apparel/shop-by-layer/baselayer/pid1000512-Men-s-ColdGear-Longsleeve-Mock/1000512-414">Under Armour ColdGear mock turtleneck</a> with an <a href="http://www.icebreaker.com/site/icebreaker_man_bodyfit260_tech_top.html">Icebreaker Bodyfit 260 TechTop</a> over top of that.  I think this combination of a tight-fitting synthetic base layer with very warm merino wool atop is the best way to go.  When the weather is very cold, such as the aforementioned bitter or windy days, I wear a <a href="http://www.descente.com/product/119595/D9-0716/_/Podium_Vest">Descente Podium</a> vest.  I top this all with a <a href="http://www.spyder.com/Mens-Insulated-Jackets/Rival-Jacket-3216.html?color=600">Spyder Rival</a> insulated jacket.</p>

<p>My hands have always been a very difficult part, but was the final piece that I solved this year.  I'm wearing a pair of <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/766531">Manzella Silkwieght Windstopper gloves</a>, which are just thin, polyester pieces, inside a set of <a href="http://www.bdel.com/gear/mercury_mitt.php">Black Diamond Mercury Mitts</a> which are absolutely wonderful.  The mitts are roomy enough that my hands with those liners fit easily, allowing me to quickly pop them out to take pictures, use my phone, or deal with my gear.  Polyester for the liners is good because it shed snow when I do pull my hands out of the mitts.  The my outer handwear also has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3126195411/">insulation that is easily removable</a>, making overnight drying a snap.</p>

<p>On bottom, I wear a single pair of <a href="http://www.smartwool.com">Smartwool</a> socks and a couple of pairs of polyester long underwear.  I should really get some wool long underwear, because it's certainly better than polypropylene.  Generally, though, I'm doing enough with my legs that I don't have that much problem.</p>

<p>Note on brands: I mention all the brands of things I wear because it makes clear exactly what I'm talking about.  Generally, the style of the item is what is important.  For example, Smartwool makes tops very similar to the Icebreaker one I mention.  I know that North Face makes tops much like the Under Armour ones that I like.  As for vests, I very much like the North Face &amp; Mountain Hardwear ones that I have, in addition to the Descente.</p>

    <p><a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/PeopleHistory/faculty/H_Shaiken.html">Harley Shaiken</a> had <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/18/pm_shaiken_commentary/">a piece on Marketplace</a> yesterday arguing that high labor costs, the sticking point for Senate Republicans concerning last week's bailout, are not a prime reason for the US auto maker's downfall.  I don't feel the need to break apart Shaiken's short argument, because he sums it up well in the final sentence, "A superior product, high productivity and high wages pave the road to a healthy economy and a decent society."  We can all agree that workers in Detroit have high wages and the indigenous car manufacturers even have <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2008/06/harbour_report_detroit_3_erasi.html">good productivity</a>; but a superior product?  Not a chance.</p>

<p>The prime reason that Asian cars sell so well in the United States is because they have a superior product at nearly every price point when compared to the US companies.  Often features are not what makes domestic cars pale compared to their Korean &amp; Japanese counterparts; usually a general air of cheapness, from bad switchgear and low-grade plastic to unsorted suspension American cars are made to a much tighter budget.  The reason?  High labor costs at the plants of domestic auto makers, an average of $78 vs. $45 for non-union plants, force those car makers to make up for these costs elsewhere.  The only way to compensate for <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200812191552DOWJONESDJONLINE000977_FORTUNE5.htm">such a large disparity</a> in costs is for the US manufacturers to cut back on the amount of money put into their product, hence the low-quality cars.</p>

    <p>This video clip from a 1977 film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074573/">Gizmo!</a> shows a 1930s newsreel clip of a man doing Parkour moves, well before such a thing had a name or community.  It's incredible to see exactly the same movements being performed 75 years before I had ever imaged doing them.  About 20 seconds in he does a wall-run top-out in the exact same fashion I've seen numerous people do on the high box at <a href="http://www.primal-fitness.com/">Primal</a>.  Neat.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2008/11/03/voting-systems/">Voting Systems</a></h2>
    <div class="article-title-date">Nov  3, 2008</div>
    <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

    <p>On the eve of the election, I am thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system">voting systems</a> better than that which is currently employed in United States <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election">general elections</a>.</p>

<p>Among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-winner_voting_system">single-winner voting systems</a>, the most common is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">instant-runoff voting</a> and the simplest, making it the most reasonable choice as a replacement for the single-vote system that we currently use.  In an instant-runoff election, you fill out a ballot showing the order of preference for the candidates available.  When votes are tallied, your number one candidate is used to tally votes; if that candidate did not achieve a majority, then he is eliminated from the election and your second choice is taken.  This continues until a candidate has achieved a majority, thereby winning the election.</p>

<p>IRV allows for voters to cast a ballot for a candidate whom they truly believe in without feeling that they are throwing their vote away.  This solves the Ralph Nader problem from the 2000 election.  Nader was the prime choice for many Americans but his status as a third-party candidate meant that he had no chance of winning the election.  Many who might have wanted to vote for Nader instead voted for one of the two major-party candidates, because their vote would otherwise be wasted.  The few who did vote for Nader, were then blamed for Al Gore's loss of the election, since they most likely would have voted for the Democratic candidate were it not for the Green Party's presence.  Instant-runoff voting keeps third-party candidates from "stealing" votes from the major parties and makes third-parties viable, since voters can feel confident in voting for such candidates.</p>

<p>Another area of voting that is lacking in the United States is the security and integrity of the voting system.  There are endless reports of electronic voting machines losing votes, miscounting votes or being tampered with.  Creating a system that is both secure and verifiable while at the same time anonymous is not a trivial task but there is a group of people who deal with such odd logic puzzles: cryptographers.  After the fiasco of electronic voting machines in the 2004 election, many people spent time thinking about methods for secure, verifiable voting.  One of those was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, the R in RSA, who came up with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreeBallot">ThreeBallot</a> voting protocol.</p>

<p>The entire protocol is <a href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest/Rivest-TheThreeBallotVotingSystem.pdf">detailed in Rivest's paper</a>, but the gist of the system is that the voter fills out three ballots which are identical, save for a unique number identifying each.  Through some cryptographic logic magic, the ballots are marked such that any single ballot of the triplet does not divulge whom the voter cast their ballot for; because the ballot is unique, however, the voter is given a copy of one of the three to take home.  This receipt can later be checked against the ballots that are published so that the voter can verify that their choice was indeed counted.  Again, this publishing doesn't divulge information about whom they voted for, despite the fact that all of the information of the election is published, allowing anyone to perform a recount.</p>

    <p>The passage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.R._1424">H.R. 1424</a>) was a good thing for rum lovers:</p>

<blockquote>
SEC. 308. INCREASE IN LIMIT ON COVER OVER OF RUM EXCISE TAX TO PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.<br />
    (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 7652(f) is amended by striking ``January 1, 2008'' and inserting ``January 1, 2010''.<br />
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply to distilled spirits brought into the United States after December 31, 2007.
</blockquote>

<p>This change extends the limit on taxation of rum from Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands to a maximum of $13.50 per gallon.  Figuring that out was not an easy process, requiring looking from the bill's amendments, to to the original text thereof, and finally to the internal revenue code being referenced.</p>

    <p>It's always interesting to see what keywords debaters drop to get their points across.  To analyze tonight's debate between Biden &amp; Palin, I grabbed a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/?iref=mpstoryview">transcript from CNN</a> that was posted shortly after.  The transcript listed each speaker's name (Biden, Ifill or Palin), followed by their first sentence in that statement, with subsequent statements on new lines.  To make it easily <code>grep</code>able,  wrote a quick Perl script to join each speaker's full passages into a single line, beginning with their name.  With that done, it's trivial to search for words the candidates spoke.  <a href="http://dinomite.net/~dinomite/vpdebate.txt">The transcript is here</a>.</p>

<p>First up, "change" and "hope", adages of the Obama campaign that McCain and Palin have picked up in recent weeks:<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (change|hope): 17</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (change|hope): 25</span></p>

<p>Which presidential candidate got more mentions?<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (John|McCain): 72</span><br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (Barack|Obama): 45</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (John|McCain): 42</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (Barack|Obama): 24</span></p>

<p>Palin's state makes a lot of energy and high prices are on the mind of voters:<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (energy): 9</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (energy): 29</span></p>

<p>Both talked a lot about the war:<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (war|iraq|afghanistan): 51</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (war|iraq|afghanistan): 58</span></p>

<p>Palin cares about her family:<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (family|child): 8</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (family|child): 15</span></p>

<p>Biden said "clean coal" a couple of times to Palin's one; they both mentioned "coal" in general more than that:<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (coal): 7</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (coal): 2</span></p>

<p>The economy was a talking point:<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (economy): 4</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (economy): 13</span></p>

<p>Only one of the candidates knows about deregulation of Wall Street in recent years:<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (deregulation): 7</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (deregulation): 0</span></p>

<p>Wall Street or Main Street?<br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (wall street): 3</span><br />
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (main street): 1</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (wall street): 5</span><br />
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (main street): 2</span></p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <p>Best known for their eponymous debut album, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(German_band)">Dune</a> is a mid-90's techno outfit whose music incorporates many of the styles endemic to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">House</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music">Dance</a> at the time.  <strong>Expedicion</strong> is a good exploration of the style, featuring lots of fast beats throughout, a bit singing vocals and even some good-old meaningless talking throughout some tracks.  The entire album is also sprinkled with radio recordings including the classic NASA piece, "we're go for auto-sequence start" on the opening track <em>Rising</em>.</p>

<p>The album opens with my favorite track, <em>Million Miles from Home</em> which incorporates some speedy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-909">808</a> beats, broken by slow and emotive sections and all with a melodic vocal loop.  The track <em>In My Dreams</em> has a very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music">IDM</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music">drum and bass</a> style to it and is topped off by vocals that are a bit more odd, but appropriate.  <em>In The Air</em>, which is split into two disparate tracks, lends a somewhat trancey feel with it's lower tempo and slower progression.  The balance of the album, including <em>Hand in Hand</em>, <em>Rainbow to the Stars</em> and <em>Around the World</em> are almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hardcore">Happy Hardcore</a> anthems, save for their just-a-bit-too-slow tempos.</p>

    <p>I listen to some podcasts daily that have annoying messages in them that never change.  With a bit of research, I came across the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ilyaz/MP3-Splitter-0.04/Splitter.pm">MP3::Splitter</a> module on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> which has somewhat confusing documentation but provides a method <code>mp3split()</code> that pulls specified pieces of a file.  You provide <code>mp3split()</code> with the input MP3 filename, options as a hash and then any number of arrays that specify which portions of the MP3 to copy into new files.  The easiest syntax for specifying a portion is to pass the start position and the length of the desired chunk, both in seconds.  From the command line, I did this:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
perl -MMP3::Splitter -e "mp3split('foo.mp3', {}, [20,25], [95,600], [950,INF])"
</pre>

<p>which creates three new MP3 files, 01_foo.mp3, 02_foo.mp3 and 03_foo.mp3.  These can then be joined to create a new MP3:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
cat 01_foo.mp3 &gt; new.mp3
cat 02_foo.mp3 &gt;&gt; new.mp3
cat 03_foo.mp3 &gt;&gt; new.mp3
</pre>

<p>Which will leave you with <code>new.mp3</code> that is a concatenation of the three pieces.  Using <code>cat</code> to join them means the resulting file will probably have some artifacts at the join points but that's not a problem for my use.  If it is, you can use something like <code>mp3join</code> to properly join the files.</p>
