    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 21, 2006</div>
    <p>Anyone who has used Unix or a derivative for long enough should know of crypt(3), the basic Unix hashing function.  Back In The Day, unices used crypt(3) for hashing passwords and It Was Good; computers were once slow enough that DES was an acceptable encryption algorithm even with a limit of 8 characters.  Since about the turn of the century (the latest one), any Unix worth it&rsquo;s salt (heh, crypto pun) offers other options for password encryption, most often MD5.  Furthermore, everything I&rsquo;ve run into, until today, used MD5 passwords by default, though Debian Potato still offered to use crypt(3) and non-shadowed passwords (knowing that came in useful in a cracking competition my freshman year).</p>

<p>Getting to the point, I logged into a Solaris machine that I set up recently and typed the password wrong, but it let me in.  At first I was&hellip;quite scared.  I logged in again, carefully typing the root password and was granted access.  I recalled the crypt(3) function&hellip;I logged in, typing the first 8 characters carefully and garbage for the rest.  I got in.  Long story short, Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) still uses crypt(3) as the default password encryption.  It&rsquo;s a simple fix, you just change a line in <code>/etc/security/policy.conf</code>, but still sort of apalling none the less.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 20, 2006</div>
    <p>I went skiing in Breckenridge, Colorado over winter break and while there I climbed above all of the lifts to the summit of Peak 8, 13,000 feet up.  I just added the <a href="http://gallery.dinomite.net/gallery/v/Skiing/Breckenridge+2006">pictures</a> to my gallery.  Here&rsquo;s a picture of the Baldy (that may just be the local name), though it&rsquo;s hard to convey just how high up the peaks are.

<p>It&rsquo;s only a few hundred yard hike to the summit since they put in the Imperial Express lift, but because I&rsquo;m from sea level, it&rsquo;s a strenuous hike.  It&rsquo;s quite steep, and involves kicking your toes into the packed snow to ascend because it&rsquo;s so steep.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 19, 2006</div>
    <p>The other night, as I was just getting into bed, the fan on my GeForce 3 started making noise.  I know it was my GPU because it had been making noise on and off for the past couple of years and no, I hadn&rsquo;t replaced the fan.  Usually hitting the thing quited it down.  Unfortunately, such a barbaric solution was unsuccessful; in my wanting-to-sleep stupor, I just ripped the fan off of the stupid round stock heatsink and went back to bed, hoping the thing wouldn&rsquo;t overheat.  It&rsquo;s been three days since then and the thing is still working fine.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 17, 2006</div>
    <p>Yesterday at a Martin Luther King, Jr. day event, Hillary Clinton mades some egregious remarks, only one of which has drawn attention of the media.  Had she refrained from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/17/clinton.plantation/">comparing the current political state to a plantation</a>, the more politically important statement that she made would have come through loud and clear.  I say that her other major point was more important because it really sums up what many people think about the current administration, but few with a voice have had the courage to say,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a culture of corruption, we have cronyism, we have incompetence</p>

<p>I predict to you that this administration will go down in history as one of the worst that has ever governed our country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really wish this quote hadn&rsquo;t been so overshadowed by the remark about plantations, as she was right on the mark.  Sounds like the sort of thing a vice president would say.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 15, 2006</div>
    <ul>
<li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
<li>1 beer (Labatt Blue was the stoutest thing we had on hand)</li>
<li>8oz. tomato paste</li>
<li>Chili powder</li>
</ul>

<p>Brown beef, drain fat.  Add beer and tomato paste, put in some chili powder, a couple of tablespoons perhaps.  Stir it up, let simmer for a few minutes.  Taste and add more chili powder until desired heat reached.  Let simmer for 2-4 hours; the flavors will meld and intensify.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 15, 2006</div>
    <p>I was reading a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS">GPS</a> which made a very good point: given their immense speed, the clocks GPS satellites are affected by relativity.  GPS satellites reside in an intermediate earth orbit such that the difference in the speed versus that of the surface of the Earth is quite significant.  Due to this great speed difference, the clocks on-board GPS satellites are affected by special (as well as general) relativity and as such differ from a clock on Earth&rsquo;s surface by about 38 microseconds per day.  For anyone who has ever been interested in relativity or quantum theory, this is an amazing example of relativity in a real-life and thoroughly used system.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/01/14/x-brace-install/">X-Brace install</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 14, 2006</div>
    <p>Installing an X brace is easy, cheap as far as mods go and provides noticeable benefit to your E36&rsquo;s handling. I got my X Brace from Circle BMW in New Jersey. You can mail order from them, as I did, or get it from your local dealer. Circle BMW and Pacific BMW are usually the cheapest prices around.</p>

<p>This is not the only how-to on the web, as you have may have already found. Check out Understeer&rsquo;s picture-filled how-to for cars that don&rsquo;t have nutserts (1995 and early 1996).</p>

<p><strong>Parts required</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>X Brace</li>
<li>4x BMW M8 bolts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tools required</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>13mm wrench/socket</li>
<li>16mm wrench/socket</li>
<li>ramps or a floor jack and jackstands</li>
<li>Lock-Tite</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I had pictures of the X brace install, but it&rsquo;s so easy it should be understandable through writing. I installed it on two cars in less than an hour using nothing than the tools listed above.  Note that you don&rsquo;t even need jack stands to do this. With the car on ramps, slide under until you are looking at the bellhousing (where the transmission meets the engine). There will be a bar going laterally across the car in that area which will be replaced by the X brace. The bolts holding this bar in place are just like many others on an e36, 16mm. Take out the two bolts, remove the bar and put the X brace in it&rsquo;s place, which should come with your new X brace.  It&rsquo;s a good idea to use Lock-Tite on all of these bolts.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re done! I took the long route to 7 Eleven and got a 52oz. Slurpee. You might test differently.  However you choose to celebrate, remember to brake late, accelerate hard and test the horn.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/01/14/m3-tranny-mounts/">M3 Tranny Mounts</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 14, 2006</div>
    <p>One of the well known problems with E36s is that the weak transmission mounts allow the transmission to shift slightly under load. When this happens, it becomes very easy to miss-shift and accidentally go into a lower gear then one intended. Doing so can cause a mechanical over-rev, destroying the engine. To rectify this problem, I bought UUC&rsquo;s Tranny Mount Enforcers.</p>

<p><strong>Parts required</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Transmission Mounts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tools required</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>16mm wrench/socket</li>
<li>13mm wrench/socket</li>
<li>ramps or floor jack and jackstands</li>
<li>Lock-Tite</li>
</ul>

<p>The transmission mount install is easy. Get the car up on ramps or jackstands such that you can fit under it from the side (I did all the work from the driver&rsquo;s side) of the car. Once under the car, look at the tail shaft of the transmission and the bridge that goes across the transmission tunnel, supporting it. Support the tail of the transmission with your jack and then remove the bridge by undoing the four bolts that hold it onto the car as well as the two bolts that hold the mounts to the transmission. Now just replace the stock mounts that are on the bridge with your new ones and re-assemble the car.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 14, 2006</div>
    <p>Bery Rinaldo made a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/beryrinaldo/AudioTron/Export_Playlist_to_M3U/"> script to export iTunes playlists as M3Us</a>, which is great and the first thing you need in order to make use of my script.  So, grab that off of his web page and install it into <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/iTunes/Scripts</code> (create that directory if you don&rsquo;t already have it).</p>

<p>I wrote this script because I wanted to be able to make a playlist and give give a friend the associated files for said playlist.  To start, use Bery&rsquo;s script from above and export a playlist.  Then grab <a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/attic/playlist.txt">my script</a> and run it, passing the name of the M3U file that you just created.  My script will create a directory in the same place as the M3U that you passed to it, fill that with the MP3s from said playlist, and create a new M3U for the directory.</username></p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 14, 2006</div>
    <p>So, apparently in Chinese culture, people send gifts to their departed love ones to ensure that their spirits live on in comfort.  One of the things that are usually sent are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Bank_Notes">Hell Bank Notes</a>, money for them to spend in the afterworld.  In other cultures, such notes are used to bribe the King of Hell, also known as the Jade Emperor or Grandpa Heaven, for the earlier release of the held spirit.  My favorite part of this Wikipedia article is the discussion of Hell Bank Note values:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the presentation, Hell Bank Notes are well known for their outrageously large denominations, ranging from $10,000, $100,000, $1,000,000 or even $500,000,000; <strong>the Chinese afterlife is apparently subject to hyperinflation</strong>.</p>
