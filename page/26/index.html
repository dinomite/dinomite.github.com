<p>Brown beef, drain fat.  Add beer and tomato paste, put in some chili powder, a couple of tablespoons perhaps.  Stir it up, let simmer for a few minutes.  Taste and add more chili powder until desired heat reached.  Let simmer for 2-4 hours; the flavors will meld and intensify.</p>

    <p>I was reading a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS">GPS</a> which made a very good point: given their immense speed, the clocks GPS satellites are affected by relativity.  GPS satellites reside in an intermediate earth orbit such that the difference in the speed versus that of the surface of the Earth is quite significant.  Due to this great speed difference, the clocks on-board GPS satellites are affected by special (as well as general) relativity and as such differ from a clock on Earth's surface by about 38 microseconds per day.  For anyone who has ever been interested in relativity or quantum theory, this is an amazing example of relativity in a real-life and thoroughly used system.</p>

    <p>Installing an X brace is easy, cheap as far as mods go and provides noticeable benefit to your E36's handling. I got my X Brace from Circle BMW in New Jersey. You can mail order from them, as I did, or get it from your local dealer. Circle BMW and Pacific BMW are usually the cheapest prices around.</p>

<p>This is not the only how-to on the web, as you have may have already found. Check out Understeer's picture-filled how-to for cars that don't have nutserts (1995 and early 1996).</p>

<p><strong>Parts required</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>X Brace</li>
  <li>4x BMW M8 bolts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tools required</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>13mm wrench/socket</li>
  <li>16mm wrench/socket</li>
  <li>ramps or a floor jack and jackstands</li>
  <li>Lock-Tite</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I had pictures of the X brace install, but it's so easy it should be understandable through writing. I installed it on two cars in less than an hour using nothing than the tools listed above.  Note that you don't even need jack stands to do this. With the car on ramps, slide under until you are looking at the bellhousing (where the transmission meets the engine). There will be a bar going laterally across the car in that area which will be replaced by the X brace. The bolts holding this bar in place are just like many others on an e36, 16mm. Take out the two bolts, remove the bar and put the X brace in it's place, which should come with your new X brace.  It's a good idea to use Lock-Tite on all of these bolts.</p>

<p>You're done! I took the long route to 7 Eleven and got a 52oz. Slurpee. You might test differently.  However you choose to celebrate, remember to brake late, accelerate hard and test the horn.</p>

    <p>One of the well known problems with E36s is that the weak transmission mounts allow the transmission to shift slightly under load. When this happens, it becomes very easy to miss-shift and accidentally go into a lower gear then one intended. Doing so can cause a mechanical over-rev, destroying the engine. To rectify this problem, I bought UUC's Tranny Mount Enforcers.</p>

<p><strong>Parts required</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Transmission Mounts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tools required</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>16mm wrench/socket</li>
  <li>13mm wrench/socket</li>
  <li>ramps or floor jack and jackstands</li>
  <li>Lock-Tite</li>
</ul>

<p>The transmission mount install is easy. Get the car up on ramps or jackstands such that you can fit under it from the side (I did all the work from the driver's side) of the car. Once under the car, look at the tail shaft of the transmission and the bridge that goes across the transmission tunnel, supporting it. Support the tail of the transmission with your jack and then remove the bridge by undoing the four bolts that hold it onto the car as well as the two bolts that hold the mounts to the transmission. Now just replace the stock mounts that are on the bridge with your new ones and re-assemble the car.</p>

    <p>Bery Rinaldo made a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/beryrinaldo/AudioTron/Export_Playlist_to_M3U/"> script to export iTunes playlists as M3Us</a>, which is great and the first thing you need in order to make use of my script.  So, grab that off of his web page and install it into <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/iTunes/Scripts</code> (create that directory if you don't already have it).</p>

<p>I wrote this script because I wanted to be able to make a playlist and give give a friend the associated files for said playlist.  To start, use Bery's script from above and export a playlist.  Then grab <a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/attic/playlist.txt">my script</a> and run it, passing the name of the M3U file that you just created.  My script will create a directory in the same place as the M3U that you passed to it, fill that with the MP3s from said playlist, and create a new M3U for the directory.&lt;/username&gt;</p>

    <p>So, apparently in Chinese culture, people send gifts to their departed love ones to ensure that their spirits live on in comfort.  One of the things that are usually sent are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Bank_Notes">Hell Bank Notes</a>, money for them to spend in the afterworld.  In other cultures, such notes are used to bribe the King of Hell, also known as the Jade Emperor or Grandpa Heaven, for the earlier release of the held spirit.  My favorite part of this Wikipedia article is the discussion of Hell Bank Note values:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless of the presentation, Hell Bank Notes are well known for their outrageously large denominations, ranging from $10,000, $100,000, $1,000,000 or even $500,000,000; <strong>the Chinese afterlife is apparently subject to hyperinflation</strong>.</p>

    <p>Port scanning is a method of finding listening services (open ports) on a
computer.  In laymen's terms, port scanning is akin to checking if doors and
windows are unlocked on a house.  It is useful for locating vulnerable computers
on a network for security auditing purposes as well as attacking them.

<img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/images/TCP.bmp" alt="TCP diagram" align="right" />

</p>
<p>To understand port scanning, you first must know how the TCP protocol works.
TCP is called a connection oriented protocol, as it initiates a connection
between two machines when they want to transfer data.  This is compared to
connectionless protocols, like UDP, which don't initiate connections or gurantee
delivery of data.  To begin a connection, the client sends a packet to the
server with the SYN flag set which tells the server it wants to initiate a
connection and where to start numbering packets.  The server responds with a
packet that has the SYN and ACK flags set, acknowleding the connection.  The
client then completes the setup of the connection by responding with a packet
having the ACK flag set.  After this point, the client and server can
communicate as a stream, sending all the data they wish.  When they have
completed sending all of their data, the connection is terminated when one of
them sends a FIN/ACK packet and the other responds with an ACK.

</p>
<p>Now that we've covered the basics of TCP, we can move on to Nmap itself.
Nmap is a featureful port scanner supporting all of the popular scanning
mechanisms including TCP connect(), SYN, FIN, Xmas and null scans.  In addition,
Nmap supports ping sweeping, operating system detection, decoy and zombie hosts.

</p>
<p>The TCP connect() scan is the simplest and Nmap's default.  All it does is
check each port on the target machine by initiating a connection using the
operating system's connect() call.  Being that it only utilizes standard system
calls available to normal users, this type of scan does not require root or
administrator priveleges.  However, the connect() is easily detected because it
is fairly noisy; the port scanner must fully initiate a connection with each
port that it finds open.

</p>
<p>A SYN scan, also knowsn as a half-open scan, only sends the first packet of a
connection initiate, the SYN packet.  It never attempts to complete the
connection, rather it simply listens for the response of the target.  If it
replies with a SYN/ACK packet, the port is in listening mode.  If it responds
with a RST/ACK, the port is closed.  The SYN scan is considered to be a stealth
scan, as the connection is never completed and therefore never registered with
any listening services.  Most modern firewalls and monitoring systems can detect
SYN scans, however.

</p>
<p>FIN, Xmas tree and null scans all work in the same manner.  The port scanner
sends a packet to the target machine out of the blue, which doesn't make sense
out of the context of a connection.  RFC 793 stipulates that closed ports should
respond to this probe with a RST whilst open ports will ignore it.  Unfortunately, this doesn't
work against Microsoft operating systems because they don't comply to the standard,
ignoring such packets instead.

</p>
<p>Because of their nature, attempting to connect to numerous ports on a
computer, port scans can usually be detected quite easily.  Most port scanners
will scan in a random order, so that their activities aren't blatantly obvious,
 but the speed and manner with which they scan is usually still easily detected.
 Many firewalls have options to detect and slow or prevent port scans.  Linux's
 current kernel-based firewall, Netfilter (IPChains) has a number of rules that
 can do this, such as rules to limit port connections over a time period.
 There are also more advanced programs, like <a href="http://www.snort.org">snort</a> and <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad">Port Scan Attack Detector (PSAD)</a>
 which can monitor for port scans, notify you of them and take action (blocking
 the scanning hosts) to prevent such scans.</p>

    <p>The new rules for the 2006 Formula 1 season were released earlier this month and they make some pretty big changes, mostly in the name of reducing the cost to participating teams.  In addition to the new 2.4-liter V8 engines, which are rev-limited to 19,000 rpm, the FIA has said that they will review bodywork to reduce downforce whilst maintain drag levels.  In this same vein of increacing reliance on mechanical grip, tire sizes have been increased and slick tires are back.  One of the big questions from last year was whtether F1 would continue to have two tire manufacturers and it looks like all of the cars will be on Bridgestones next year.  Cars will continue to have only a single set of tires for the race and in addition to three-weekend engines, transmissions will have to last four events.</p>

<p>Of the more obvious cost-cutting measures was the reduction of the minimum weight from 590 to 550 kilograms (1300 to 1212 pounds).  The reason for this is that all of the cars in the series have been <em>well</em> under the former limit and to reach the minimum used expensive tungsten, chosen for it's very high density.  As always, the astonishing thing about these number is that a standard small passenger car is just shy of 3000 pounds and yet produces less than one quarter of the horsepower of a Formula 1 car.</p>
