    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 24, 2007</div>
    <p>In the State of the Union last night, Bush proposed a way to the way health care is taxed.  This announcement was something of a surprise &ndash; the first I heard of it was Monday morning.  It sounds sort of complicated, but once all laid out, it&rsquo;s fairly straightforward.  Currently, if you get health insurance from your employer you don&rsquo;t pay any tax on the cost of the plan.  Similarly, those who are self-employed can deduct the cost of their health insurance from their taxable income.  Anyone who pays their own health insurance outright, either because their employer doesn&rsquo;t offer it or they can&rsquo;t qualify for the plans that their employer offers, pay that expense after tax.</p>

<p>Under Bush&rsquo;s new plan, that last group would be allowed to deduct their health insurance cost.  The loss in tax revenue would come from a change to the taxation of those in the employer-paid insurance group; their insurance payments would be taxed if they exceed $15,000 for a family or $7,500 for an individual.  If your annual healthcare premiums are less than those limits, you would see no change and it would still be tax free.  The idea here is that this change covers the lost tax revenue while at the same time discouraging employers from offering overly-generous healthcare coverage and encourage the creation of low-cost plans that don&rsquo;t currently exist.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 18, 2007</div>
    <p>This week and last, news outlets have mentioned the <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/business/article/0,1426,MCA_440_5278441,00.html">rising price of tortillas</a> in Mexico.  It seems humorous on the surface but tortillas are the staple food of Mexico&rsquo;s poor and the 14% increase in prices for the commodity in the past year, as compared to the country&rsquo;s 4% inflation, is significant for many.  Tortillas have increased in price because the white corn from which they are made has similarly increased in value due in part to the increased demand for yellow corn that is used to make ethanol.</p>

<p>One of the authors of Freaknomics, Stephen Dubner, recently <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/01/10/will-the-high-price-of-oil-make-americans-skinnier/">mentioned in his blog</a> that these increase in corn prices stem from the high price of oil, which bolsters demand for ethanol.  Anyone who has read <em>The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dillema</em> knows that corn is the basis for nearly all industrially produced food in the United States.  Could Dubner be right that this oil prices could lead to less obese Americans through a convoluted chain of corn?</p>

    <p>I found the archives of the <a href="http://men.style.com/gq/fashion/styleguy">GQ Style Guy</a> today, which has answered numerous style questions I had.  It&rsquo;s also peppered with some serious wit:</p>

    <p>Generally the commercials shown on TV are targeted at the viewers of the channel or show in question.  Can anyone explain why I see UFC ads on FoodTV?  Is there really much overlap in their viewing demographics?</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 28, 2006</div>
    <p>My MythTV installation hasn&rsquo;t been working for a couple of weeks and I hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to fixing it until today; shows you how much TV matters to me when I&rsquo;m busy.  It was a really easy error to fix - simply a crashed table which was quick to diagnose and fix even though I hadn&rsquo;t ever encountered anything of the sort before.  For Google-searchers, the error from mythbackend was as follows:</p>

<p><code><pre>
&lt;snip&gt;
2006-11-28 17:38:35.805 DB Error (UpdateMatches):
Query was:
DELETE FROM program WHERE manualid = -1 OR  (manualid &lt;&gt; 0 AND -1 = -1)
Driver error was [2/145]:
QMYSQL3: Unable to execute query
Database error was:
Table &#39;./mythconverg/program&#39; is marked as crashed and should be repaired
&lt;/snip&gt;
</pre></code></p>

<p>To fix it, I simply had to login to the database, &lsquo;use mythconverg;&rsquo;, and issue the command &#39;repair table program;&rsquo;.  As noted below, make sure you see those semicolons.  Simple.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 13, 2006</div>
    <p>A friend made me a CD a few weeks ago and included a sublime rendition of <i>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</i> and <i>What a Wonderful World</i>, but he didn&rsquo;t know who the artist was.  I heard the same song on a commercial for Rice Krispies today while watching CNN.  I quickly went to my computer and used Google to dispatch a query through the tubes of The Internet which led me to <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061003162121AADpJlo">this Yahoo! Answers page</a> that solved the mystery.  Apparently the song was also featured in <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/">50 First Dates</a></i>.</p>

<p>The song is by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Kamakawiwo%27ole">Israel Kamakawiwo&#39;ole</a>, who is certainly not who you&rsquo;d expect if you hear the very ethereal nature of his rendition.  Iz, made numerous albums in the style of his native Hawaii often advocating Hawaiian independence.  His music features a lot of ukulele, much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Shimabukuro">Jake Shimabukuro</a>, who has also grabbed my interest recently.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 11, 2006</div>
    <p>Though about a year and a half old, <a href="http://www.mindjack.com/feature/piracy051305.html">this is a very good article</a> (and presentation; scroll down) about the positive effect that piracy can have.  Written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pesce">Mark Pesce</a>, this is a case study of how <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>&rsquo;s distribution via BitTorrent changed the viewership of that show; bringing it to Americans before the scheduled release and to Australia where it wasn&rsquo;t set to be available at all.  Further, he goes on to explore the ways that advertisers can still profit from this model that cuts out television networks who normally marry shows with advertisements.</p>

<p>We now live in a time where many people (myself included) don&rsquo;t know or care when the shows they want to watch are broadcast or what channel they are one.  If you simply get your TV from the internet, the channel and time simply don&rsquo;t matter. Nor do the advertisements, which are normally snipped from interweb-released shows.  Are we soon to see TV funded by product placement, layover placards and bugs?</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov  8, 2006</div>
    <p>I saw Borat this weekend and though I would say it was good, it feels like a stretch to make the character&rsquo;s exploits into a full-length film.  I think I&rsquo;ll see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056187/">Sacha Baron Cohen&rsquo;s</a> next movie when it comes out on DVD.  Also, see this <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2152789/?nav=ais">interesting piece</a> on how Borat&rsquo;s portrayal of Kazakhstan compares to the real nation.</p>
