    <p>I saw Borat this weekend and though I would say it was good, it feels like a stretch to make the character's exploits into a full-length film.  I think I'll see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056187/">Sacha Baron Cohen's</a> next movie when it comes out on DVD.  Also, see this <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2152789/?nav=ais">interesting piece</a> on how Borat's portrayal of Kazakhstan compares to the real nation.</p>

    <p>I was just watching a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv4vj_vlIOw">Daily Show clip</a> featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd">Senator Robert Byrd</a>, who just recently surpassed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a> as the longest serving senator in history.  Aside from his avowed obsession with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_barrel">pork</a>, he is quite the screwball and reminds me a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn">Foghorn Leghorn</a>.

    <p>Bombay changed it's name to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Mumbai</a> more than 10 years ago yet news stories concerning the city on the Western coast of India usually still reference the name under British rule.  Surely this most populous city in the country and one of the largest in the world has enough cachet that we can all recognize it's name without being prompted by the past.  The Indians are already well on their way to being an econmic powerhouse after all and Mumbai is the center of this emerging market.</p>

    <p>I installed Azureus on my Ubuntu machine recently and found it to absolutely <em>peg</em> the CPU when downloading more than a few torrents at once.  I know that Bittorrent is a pretty CPU intensive protocol, but I had been running similar numbers of torrents on the same machine using <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/net/bittornado">bittornado</a> with much less ado.  By default, Ubuntu installs the <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/interpreters/java-gcj-compat">GCJ Java virtual machine</a>, which is a perfectly serviceable JVM, but I suspected it wasn't as good as Sun's own.  I'll shall not decree that Sun's JVM is better than GCJ, as I didn't actually run any tests, but Azureus runs faster now that I'm using the Sun machine.  Onward.</p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty simple install. First, because of how Sun's JVM is licensed, you need to manually download it from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">the Sun site</a>.  If you plan on compiling Java code, get the Java Development Kit (JDK); if you don't write software, you can just get the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  Either way, make sure you get the vanilla package, not the RPM (RedHat package).</p>

<p>Once you have that, you need to install <code>java-package</code> using apt-get.  You will first need to change two lines in your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file, adding <code>universe</code> and <code>multiverse</code> as is shown below:</p>

<p><code>
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted <b>universe multiverse</b><br />
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted <b>universe multiverse</b>
</code></p>

<p>Open a terminal and type this in, answering "yes" to any questions the program asks:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install java-package</code></p>

<p>Now, you just need to make a .deb out of Sun's Java package that you grabbed.  In the same terminal, change to the directory where said package resides and run the following, once again choosing happy answers like 'y' and 'yes' when you are presented with quesions:</p>

<p><code>chmod +x *.bin; fakeroot make-jpkg *.bin; sudo dpkg -i sun-j2sdk*.deb</code></p>

<p>Easy as that.  To make this the default JVM simply run the following command:</p>

<p><code>sudo update-java-alternatives --config java</code></p>

    <p>I'm doing a project on MD5 collisions for my parallel computing class and, like all cryptography, the code involves a lot of hex numbers (in standard notation, 0xf00d, 0xbeef, etc.) which naturaly makes parts of the code difficult to read.  That's simply the nature of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Algorithm">the algorithm</a>.  Some programmers (often just mathematicians) insist on making the code even more illedgible with things like this:</p>

<p><code>while (counter &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; 9))</code></p>

<p>The bigger problem is that when I see something like that I'm confused; I am both impressed by their cleverness (that loops while counter is less than 512) but also annoyed by their needless obfuscation.  I guess one could argue that a left shift is more ledgible, because if it were a number larger than 10 or so, people wouldn't know the significance.  Who really knows of the top of their head that 262144 is 2^18?  So, in the end, it's not necessarily just obfuscation but really, most programmers will recognize at least up to 2^10 and those who know the internets should know 2^16 as well.</p>

    <p>As I read more about cryptography (I'm currently making my way through the great tome, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471117099/sr=8-1/qid=1145849010/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6924799-8398511?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Applied Cryptography</a>) I've been thinking more about random number generators.  Whenever you read about cryptography or how they build slot machines (Kevin Mitnick covers this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764569597/sr=8-1/qid=1145849136/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6924799-8398511?%5Fencoding=UTF8">The Art of Intrusion</a>) there is talk of how bad computer random number generators are, particularly the standard functions that are part of Java, libc or .NET.  Even if you take the time to seed them, the pseudo-randomness is of quite low quality.  I just found an article on some <a href="http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/random_number_generation">random number generators you can implement yourself</a>.  Cool.</p>

    <p>News to me: you can use The Internet from planes now; I knew that this was in the works, but I didn't think it had actually been implemented yet.  Apparently Lufthansa (others?) has WiFi planes that communicate with the outside world via satellite links.  As is thoroughly explained in <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2006/04/tracking_plane_flight_on_inter.shtml">this post</a>, the plane connects to a geostationary satellite and has it's own /24 network.  The planes intelligently decide which satellite to use based upon which will produce shorter routing at the ground station and are able to dynamically change this throughout the flight.  As the Renesys blogger shows, the planes announce their route changes thus allowing graceful switches amongst the satellites.  Cool.</p>

    <p>Ever drive behind an ambulance and notice the chains hanging from the rear axel?  I've always wondered what those were for and today listening to CarTalk they suggested to a guy who was complaining about being shocked by his car to use a ground strap or chains that would drag on the ground to…ground the car.  For ambulances, I would bet that being at ground potential is importand for their instruments (EKG?) or perhaps they just don't want to shock people.  Interesting.</p>

    <p>I've been using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> for some time now and I absolutely love it.  Not only can I access my bookmarks from any machine, it's easy for me to point people to collections of information that I've made and the organization is far superior to any other mothodology.  The public-ness of it brings up an interesting vulnerability, that of spying using del.icio.us.  Say that you know I write code for some software company and you have been hired to do industrial espionage for a competing firm; you can probably get a good idea of what I'm working on by the links that I grab.  Just a thought.</p>
