    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 25, 2014</div>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH64dlgyydM">I like dogs</a> and recently got a beaglish one of my own from the <a href="http://www.lostdogrescue.org/">Lost Dog Foundation</a>.  While wonderful, he has the affliction of walking excitement common to hunting hounds—appropriate to his name, Scout wants to lead the way and suss out any squirrels to be found.  At only 25 pounds, he won&rsquo;t drag you down the street, but the constant tugging on the leash is tiring.  I&rsquo;ve tried a number of collars &amp; harnesses to try to combat this problem, and what follows are my opinions on them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/11892424355/"><img src='http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/11892424355_bd7c2bcc67_z.jpg' alt='Scout being Rowdy'></a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.cesarsway.com/shop/Illusion-Dog-Collar-Leash-System">Illusion Collar</a></h2>

<p>My girlfriend had been watching a lot of <a href="http://www.cesarsway.com/">Caesar Millan</a> before we got our dog and we put a fair bit of stock in his methods.  Using a leash in the way that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjub9dCBiv8">Caesar describes</a>, well up the dog&rsquo;s neck and close to the ears, allowed us to control Scout, but the leash wouldn&rsquo;t stay there, so we figured it was worth trying the oddly-named[^1] Illusion Collar to make this easier.</p>

<p>While the Illusion collar does what it&rsquo;s supposed to, keeping the operative part of the collar well up the dog&rsquo;s neck for better control, this did nothing for Scout and he remaiined unruly on walks.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ZBKG4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0009ZBKG4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dinomitenet-20">PetSafe Easy Walk Harness</a></h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found this harness to be by far the most effective.  The harness has a circle of straps around the dog&rsquo;s body, just behind their shoulders and a strap across the dog&rsquo;s chest.  The front strap has a cinching portion to which the leash clips, tightening a bit when the dog pulls.  More importantly, because the attachment is on the dog&rsquo;s chest, the force of any pulling turns them sideways, greatly limiting thier ability to pull.</p>

<p>The downside to the Easy Walk is that the strap behind the dog&rsquo;s front legs can rub their fur-less armpits raw, as I&rsquo;ve found with Scout and other friends have reported.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085XOHDU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0085XOHDU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dinomitenet-20">Freedom No-Pull Harness</a></h2>

<p>This is set up similarly to the PetSafe Easy Walk mentioned above, but with additional versatility.  Like the PetSafe it has an attachment point on the dog&rsquo;s chest, with all of the noted advantages &amp; disadvantages, though the front attachment on the Freedom No-Pull isn&rsquo;t cinching.  Where it does have a cinching attachment point is on the dog&rsquo;s back between their shoulder blades.  Using this attachment doesn&rsquo;t provide nearly the pulling prevention of the front attachment, but it does keep from driving the underbody strap into the dog&rsquo;s armpits and chafing them.</p>

<p>The intended arrangement is to clip a leash into both attachments and use it like a horse&rsquo;s reins—tug on the front one when the dog pulls to correct the behavior.  This is effective, but it does halve the length of your leash.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2013/06/27/goruck-challenge-preparation/">GORUCK Challenge</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jun 27, 2013</div>
    <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/9157378869/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3713/9157378869_d05b4078ef_z.jpg"/></a>

<p>I did the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/events/Challenge">GORUCK Challenge</a> last
weekend.  The GORUCK Challenge is a 12 hour guided tour of a city, led by
special forces guys known as the Cadre.  Every challenge, even in the same city,
is a different experience, tailored by the Cadre based upon their desires, the
folks on the team, and what the city has to offer.</p>

<h2>Class 662 Summary</h2>

<p>A team of 34 people, each with a 45-55 pound rucksack hiked &amp; ran 20 miles
around San Francisco over the course of 12 hours.  We were accompanied by two 30
pound bags of quarters, a ~100 pound log, and, for about half of the time,
a ~300 pound couch adorned with a 210-230 pound person. In the last few hours,
we swapped the couch for a pair of 250 pound logs.</p>

<h2>Difficulty</h2>

<p>Overall the event was a <em>ton</em> of fun.  Having read numerous things in the weeks
leading up to this, my first challenge, I had gotten a bit worried.  The number
of people who listed this as the hardest thing they&rsquo;d ever done and hinted
at the misery they endured made it sound like a rough, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I did
that. Once.&rdquo; sort of thing.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If
you&rsquo;re physically capable, you&rsquo;ll have a good time until the end.</p>

<p>What do I mean by capable?  I don&rsquo;t think a single test other than the Challenge
itself (or perhaps doing a Light and saying it was easy) could make it clear,
but I can put it in CrossFit terms.  CrossFit + weight lifting is my main
regimen, 3-4 days a week at <a href="http://www.patriotcrossfit.com/blog/">Patriot CrossFit</a>
in Arlington if you want to get an idea of the programming.  I&rsquo;m certainly no
firebreather, but I manage to do a majority of the workouts as prescribed and
in fairly good time.  If you can follow the <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/">main site</a>,
doing half of the workouts as prescribed without being horribly slow, you&rsquo;ll be
fine.  You need not be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ27XzR3HJc">Jason Kaplan</a>
to be in good enough shape—my 7 minute Fran is enough to make the Challenge a
non-killer event.</p>

<h1>Notes on Preparation</h1>

<h2>Hydration</h2>

<p>I say hydration here because I think something more than water is important.
I used a <a href="https://www.goruck.com/Gear/Details/low-profile-hydration-bladder">low-profile SOURCE bladder</a>
which fit well in the main compartment between my bricks and the main flap.
I filled it with water and 6 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QW1L72/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B001QW1L72&amp;adid=16NHVNWNJT4379CHRA7K&amp;">Nuun tablets</a>
initially, and tossed in a few more tablets when I refilled at around 0300.  We
didn&rsquo;t stop for water again and I was out near the end of the challenge, along
with most of the team.  If my next Challenge is anywhere warmer, I&rsquo;ll find a way
to have a second bladder or even a couple of Nalgenes.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>I often deride cyclists for their obsession with fast carbs, thinking that
without sucking down maltodextrin every 20 minutes they might just go from being
a world-class überathelete on their Yellow Polkadot Single Baller Edition
Cervélo to a prole riding a Mongoose.  But it is to cyclists whom I turned when
gathering supplies for this challenge.  In the end, I downed seven gels and two
packs of chewie jobbies throughout the 12 hours.  Are those absolutely
necessary?  Not at all, I could have gotten through without any of that and
gone strict paleo with some bananas or some such.  But it would have sucked.
Having good blood sugar support after glycogen stores are depleted increases
your ability to perform for sure; more importantly, the carbohydrate combined
with caffeine improves mood, keeping the event from being a gruelling death
march.</p>

<p>So hit up your local bike shop and get some of those goofy fast acting
carbohydrate sources.  I had a couple of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0010TADUW/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0010TADUW&amp;adid=01XQGWDWXR3T3TSYGRMM&amp;">Honey Stingers</a>
(which are mostly honey) but most of what I brought were caffeinated (35mg or
70mg depending on the flavor) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007I6NLFU/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B007I6NLFU&amp;adid=0YDREPJX49416514ZN73&amp;">Gu Roctane</a>
energy gels.  I drink tea regularly, so I think the regular-strength (35mg) ones
were best for me.  Next time I&rsquo;ll probably bring 10 gels along with a bunch of
the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041HKO3G/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0041HKO3G&amp;adid=1KMX5P2VRMECJ8Q9Q0NJ&amp;">chewie versions</a>.
The chewies are amazingly delightful after you&rsquo;ve speed marched across the city.
If you&rsquo;re the prepared sort, it&rsquo;d be good to bring some extra.  Even amongst
such a rarefied group there are knuckleheads who bring little to no food.  If
someone&rsquo;s performance falls off, a caffeinated gel is a great way to bring them
back.</p>

<p>I also brought a few bars (Luna or UberFood, I think) but only ate one.  It&rsquo;s
nice to have something different during a long break (5 minutes).</p>

<h2>Clothing</h2>

<p>This challenge was during June in San Francisco.  For those who don&rsquo;t know,
that&rsquo;s winter.  Paradoxically, it wasn&rsquo;t windy <em>or</em> foggy that night, but it was
a bit cold.</p>

<p>I wore Under Armour leggings, some Champion workout shorts, <a href="http://www.drymaxsocks.com/running_hyper_thin.php">Drymax socks</a>,
a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00275Q8ZW/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B00275Q8ZW&amp;adid=0JWP8VED4W44F2TK8VZ7&amp;">padded football shirt</a>,
a long-sleeve Under Armour Cold Gear top, and a workout shirt over that.</p>

<p>Unsure of my shoe choice up until the day of The Challenge, I settled on Inov8
F-Lite 195s.  I&rsquo;ve been wearing minimalist shoes (Merrel Trail Gloves are my
favorites) exclusively for a few years now, but I was concerned that the extra
weight on my back would lead to a Bad Time for my feet &amp; knees.  I had bought
some F-Lite 230s which were what I had planed on until the day of, but I settled
on the 195s because my feet feel better in them.  They were just fine, despite
the weight and surfaces we were walking on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/surgeonknot.htm"><img src="http://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/FinishedSurgeonKnot1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>The other thing you need to do is <a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/surgeonknot.htm">tie your shoes properly</a>.
If you can slip your shoes off without untying them, they aren&rsquo;t tied properly.
We had to stop multiple times during our first time hack in which we needed to
cover 3.5 miles in 35 minutes due to shoes that came untied or got flat tired.
Properly tying your shoes completely prevents both of these and will keep your
teammates from thinking you&rsquo;re incompetent from the beginning.</p>

<p>Pockets.  You want pockets.  Movements are often an hour or more, during which
time you don&rsquo;t have opportunity to dig around your pack for the aforementioned
sugary delights.  Every time you stop, ensure your pockets have a gel or two in
them.  Pockets are also where you&rsquo;ll shove the trash after you down one of those
as cadre are strict about littering, rightly so.</p>

<h2>Your Ruck</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/9159389132/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5540/9159389132_4c88fea201_c.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/9159343672/"><img class=right src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/9159343672_fa6d911781.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Do something to your ruck so that you can differentiate it from everyone elses.
All cadre are different, but you&rsquo;ll end up taking your ruck off and passing it
to teammates at some point in the night, and if they all look the same, it&rsquo;s
impossible to find your own.  I had a light-colored War Stories &amp; Free Beer
patch so that I could identify my GR1 from the back; the loops of cord that I
use to hold my hydration tube makes it notable from the front.</p>

<p>Having a black Omega carabiner clipped through three MOLLE sure does look cool,
but it&rsquo;s not particularly funcitonal.  I have one on my ruck and it&rsquo;s nice for
briefly attaching a water bottle or my bike helmet, but it&rsquo;s really difficult
to remove for other uses.  When your ruck is jammed full of bricks, water, and
yoga blocks, you can&rsquo;t manipulate the fabric enough to remove the &lsquo;biner
easily, so save yourself the hassle and have it only clipped through two loops
so that it&rsquo;s faster to get at.</p>

<h2>Other Junk</h2>

<p>Minimize it, but don&rsquo;t go crazy.  There are endless words written to the effect
of &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not sure, don&rsquo;t bring it&rdquo;.  I largely subscribe to this mentality,
as you most likely aren&rsquo;t going to need things, but there&rsquo;s a dose of realism
that is needed here.  Between the 30 pounds of bricks and the 10 pounds of
water and misc that are the minimum weight, you aren&rsquo;t going to notice a few
extra food bars, gels, or a windbreaker, so don&rsquo;t sweat it.  If the weather is
on the edge of being cold, bring the windbreaker.  I always carry a Sharpie &amp;
a pen in my ruck day to day and was sad that I didn&rsquo;t have them when we needed
to write things down.</p>

<p>Things to certainly not bring are those that will absorb water.  Carrying around
a small portion of your local body of water is a bad time.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Dec  3, 2012</div>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/8248913885/in/photostream/"><img class=right src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8486/8248913885_8828ee2a54.jpg" alt="GORUCK GR Echo with 4 bricks & yoga block"/></a></p>

<p>I have finally signed up for a <a href="https://www.goruckchallenge.com/">GORUCK Challenge</a>.  The event is 6 months off, but thanks to Jason posting <a href="http://www.gorucknews.com/challenge/wrapping-bricks-explained/">Wrapping Bricks Explained</a> I&rsquo;ve been playing around with packing bricks in my rucks.</p>

<p>I followed the instructions on the above mentioned post for wrapping the bricks in pairs and took Asha Wagner&rsquo;s <a href="http://nuffsaid6.blogspot.com/2011/11/goruck-tough-sf-class-086.html">advice for securing the bricks</a> in a GORUCK pack using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007A2XFYE/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B007A2XFYE&amp;adid=14454BYTXX0X67M3EC7K&amp;">Sea to Summit &frac34;&quot; straps</a> to secure them on the ruck&rsquo;s internal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouch_Attachment_Ladder_System">PALS webbing</a>.  To the right are two pairs of bricks (4 total) in a GR Echo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty light, just under 150 most days, so 4 bricks is the prescription.  A yoga block is the perfect thing to fill the extra space—dense but soft and about the size of two bricks.  One note is that you can indeed fit 6 bricks into a GR Echo, with just a bit of room to spare.  The third package of bricks takes the place of the yoga block, with a bit of space on either side.  Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t nearly enough space for a hydration bladder along with them.  If you&rsquo;re taking 6 bricks to the Challenge, get a GR1 or Radio Ruck.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2012/09/11/tough-mudder-mid-atlantic-2013/">Tough Mudder Mid-Atlantic 2012</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Sep 11, 2012</div>
    <p>After not doing Tough Mudder <a href="http://dinomite.net/blog/2010/tough-mudder-norcal-2010/">since 2010</a>,
I signed up for the Mid-Atlantic event this year.  Here&rsquo;s my advice for folks
looking for tips before running.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I&rsquo;ve exercised almost exclusively in <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm">Vibram
FiveFingers</a> mainly because I feel
so much more stable when running &amp; jumping.  Since switching to minimalist
street shoes for everyday wear (<a href="http://www.merrell.com/US/en-us/Product.mvc.aspx/22875M/50390/Mens/Barefoot-Run-Trail-Glove">Merrell Trail Gloves</a>
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004KZP5AG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B004KZP5AG&amp;adid=05E13DHZT6EMTB01FEFZ">New Balance Minimus</a>)
my knees, hips, and back seem happier.  Last time I did Tough Mudder, I wore
some old cross-trainer style tennis shoes, but by this point I&rsquo;ve gotten rid of
all the thick-soled tennis shoes I once had.  I ended up wearing my New Balance
MT20s for the run and they worked very well.  Clearning them after the race was
just a few minutes of hosing them off outside and then tossing them in the
washing machine.</p>

<p>I wore some Mechanix gloves (the basic velcro cuff model) the first time I did
Tough Mudder.  This time I brought some along but chose not to wear them. There
are only a couple of obstacles for which you might want them, and I don&rsquo;t think
those are sufficiently abrasive or splintery to extra mudweight you carry in
gloves.  Focus on wearing as little clothing as possible—the first time you hit
a mud pit your shirt &amp; shorts carry a lot of it with you.</p>

<p>Training is another big question that people have.  Mine is pretty much the same
as previously: I do CrossFit 2-3 times a week and 1-2 days a week of Olympic
lifting.  In the 6 months prior to doing Tough Mudder I went on a couple of ~3.5
mile runs.  The only other running I did was the occasional CrossFit WOD that
involved a 400 or 800 meter run.  I think that pretty well drives home my
admonition that you don&rsquo;t need to run a lot to be a competent runner and perform
well in endurance running events.</p>

<p>Having said that, this Tough Mudder was the same as last—85% of the people walk
the majority of the event; another 10% run between half of the obstacles.
Running the whole way easily puts you in the top 5% of participants.  Aside from
being well prepared physically and highly self motivated, the best way to run
the whole way is to do it with a group of friends.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Aug 12, 2012</div>
    <p><img src="http://dinomite.smugmug.com/Other/Gear/i-9ZzG8wn/0/L/MG0232-L.jpg" class=right alt="GORUCK GR1 with Crumpler Haven inside" /></p>

<p>I recently picked up a <a href="http://www.crumpler.com/us/Camera-Bags/Camera-Pouches/Haven-M.html">Crumpler Haven</a> to use for carrying my Canon 40D.  I purchased the medium size with some trepadation, as their size recommendations sugges that it won&rsquo;t fit anything larger than a compact SLR (Canon Rebel, Nikon D3x00).  It seems that th suggestions are too conservative—my 40D fits just fine with the Canon 10-22mm or 17-55mm affixed and leaves enough room for a 50mm alongside.  You can&rsquo;t fit two big lenses, like the aforementioned zooms, in the bag simultaneously, but you can reverse my setup (50mm on the camera, bigger lens beside it).</p>

<p>The Haven has proved quite nice.  It&rsquo;s enough on its own to toss in the car if I don&rsquo;t plan on walking much in my journey.  More importantly, it fits perfectly in a <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">GR1</a> beside a liter of water.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 19, 2012</div>
    <p>There are enough BMW E36 cars out there owned by enthusiasts that nearly any problem you have there is a do-it-yourself tutorial for fixing on the internet. Dead window motors is no different&ndash;Doug Vetter has <a href="http://www.dvatp.com/bmw/diy/power_window/">a very detailed description</a> of how to replace the window motor &amp; regulator on the E36.  Seriously, if you&rsquo;re going to to do this fix (or are wondering whether you should), go check out Doug&rsquo;s page.  The only amendment I&rsquo;ll make to his description is about replacing the window motor only, without removing the regulator.  In short, doing so is possible, but a (cheap!) special tool is required.</p>

<p>Doug&rsquo;s instructions mention that a low-profile ratchet is required to remove the window motor with the regulator in place, and when he says low-profile, he means it.  I bought one of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XYOUS6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000XYOUS6">these cheap ratchets</a> on Amazon in preparation for this job.  While it doesn&rsquo;t have the requisite T-30 bit, this style of ratchet is the only thing that will fit in the space between the door and de-riveted window regulator.  Check your local hardware store for the T-30 bit&ndash;regular old interchangeable screwdriver bits fit perfectly.  Beyond that, follow Doug&rsquo;s instructions for breaking the window regulator rivets, use your $9 ratchet to unbolt the motor, and bolt the shiny, expensive new motor in its place.

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2011/10/26/perl-and-dubstep/">Perl and Dubstep</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Oct 26, 2011</div>
    <p>In the past year, I have come to quite like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep">dubstep</a>, a burgeoning electronic music genre.  Perhaps <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXO-jKksQkM">this</a> is a more interesting introduction than an article.  Dubstep&rsquo;s current phase reminds me of generalized techno (mostly house &amp; dance) during the mid-90&rsquo;s&ndash;a huge variety of styles, many small artists, much of it distributed through non-traditional channels.  In the late 90&rsquo;s the distribution was via early filesharing networks, most notably Napster.  For Dubstep, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&amp;search_query=dubstep%20remix&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/dubstep/">Mixcloud</a>, and <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/dubstep/">Soundcloud</a> seem to be the preferred ways of getting new tracks out.</p>

<p>To chronicle and share this growth of a genre, I started <a href="https://twitter.com/dailywub">@DailyWub</a>, a Twitter account that posts a new dubstep track every day.  Being an engineer, I found the idea of manually keeping a queue and posting a track every day to be a dreadful task.  For some time, the account has been powered by <a href="www.bufferapp.com">Buffer</a>, a simple webapp that allows you to create a queue of tweets that are metered out at a schedule of your choosing.  Buffer is ok, but they limit the queue to 10 tweets, and at some point started shortening URLs even when not needed, which breaks the YouTube thumbnails in many Twitter clients.  Having a queue that is regularly plucked from and emitted to Twitter is a fairly simple operation, so I wrote my own program to do it&ndash;<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::Twitter::Queue">Net::Twitter::Queue</a>.</p>

<p>Net::Twitter::Queue is a simple Perl module that employs <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::Twitter">Net::Twitter</a> to do the heavy lifting.  To use it, I have a queue of tweets in a file, <code>tweets.yaml</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
- Caspa - Where's My Money? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myZU2DZoD9w
- Skrillex - First Of The Year http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cXDgFwE13g
- Rusko - Everyday http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDAX2aVWAag
</pre>

<p>When run, Net::Twitter::Queue will remove the top item from that YAML file and post it to Twitter using the account information specified in <code>config.yaml</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
consumer_key: [consumer_key]
consumer_secret: [consumer_secret]
access_token: [access_token]
access_token_secret: [access_token_secret]
</pre>

<p>Where do those values come from?  Two places: the consumer information is on the page for your application at <a href="https://dev.twitter.com">dev.twitter.com</a> (go ahead, make one!) and the access tokens are specific to the account you want to post as.  To generate them, I used <a href="https://github.com/marcel/twurl">Twurl</a>.  With the consumer key &amp; secret in hand, simply run Twurl:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
Titus:~/$ twurl authorize --consumer-key [consumer_key] \
--consumer-secret [consumer_secret]
</pre>

<p>Twurl will respond with a URL that you can visit in a web browser, login to Twitter with the account you want to post as, and get a PIN back.  Give the PIN to Twurl and it will complete the authentication process, saving the access token &amp; associated secret in your <code>~/.twurlrc</code>.  Grab those two, toss them into <code>config.yaml</code> and run Net::Twitter::Queue from the directory that has <code>config.yaml</code> &amp; <code>tweets.yaml</code> in it:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
caligula:~/twitter/dailywub$ ls
config.yaml  tweets.yaml
caligula:~/twitter/dailywub$ perl -MNet::Twitter::Queue -e \
'$q=Net::Twitter::Queue->new->tweet'
</pre>

<p>Easy as that&ndash;the top entry in <code>tweets.yaml</code> has been popped and posted to Twitter. </p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2011/10/22/creating-a-perl-module-in-modern-style/">Creating a Perl Module in Modern Style</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Oct 22, 2011</div>
    <p>One of the very best things about Perl is <a href="https://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a>, a repository of modules to do everything from <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/WWW::Mechanize">browse the web</a> to <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Image::Magick">manipulating image files</a>.  CPAN provides a consistent method for installing modules (<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/App::cpanminus#Installing-to-system-perl">install cpanminus</a> and then <code>cpanm &lt;Module::Name&gt;</code>) and the largest number of modules of all the scripting languages.  More often than not, what you are trying to do has already been done and exists as a CPAN module.  In the event you are doing something new, the best way to give back to the community and get free help is to encapsulate your work and distribute it as a module on CPAN.</p>

<p>Historically, creating a module suitable for general consumption was a confusing.  Tutorials <a href="http://world.std.com/~swmcd/steven/perl/module_mechanics.html">from years past</a> abound, <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=431702">each one longer</a> <a href="http://members.pcug.org.au/~rcook/PerlModule_HOWTO.html">than the previous</a>, and <a href="http://mathforum.org/~ken/perl_modules.html">always employing a different toolchain</a>, making synthesis of common concepts impossible.  These days, however, things are much easier.  In the past 6 years or so the Perl community has tried on a <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">number</a> of <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Build">methods</a> for <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Install">building</a> modules.  The focus of this article will be a recent (circa late 2009&hellip;the Perl ecosystem takes a measured pace) build system, <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a>.</p>

<p>Whereas <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Build">Module::Build</a> are systems for building, testing, and installing a release, Dist::Zilla sits at a higher level.  With Dist::Zilla, you create a single file that controls the build &amp; test flow (using <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> under the hood) but also provide functionality for generating semi-boilerplate files (LICENSE, MANIFEST, META.yml) and releasing the code via CPAN.  The configuration file, <code>dist.ini</code>, is easy-to-read and short in contrast to prior build systems.</p>

<p>To start using Dist::Zilla, install it using the standard CPAN shell command (<code>cpan -i Dist::Zilla</code>) or with cpanminus (<code>cpanm Dist::Zilla</code>).  You utilize Dist::Zilla through the command <code>dzil</code>; if that&rsquo;s not in your path (<code>which dzil</code>), then you&rsquo;ll want to find it and symlink it somewhere useful or add it to your path.  Global setup of dzil is done by invoking <code>dzil setup</code> and answering the questions it poses.  With that done you can very easily mint a new distribution:</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2011/05/22/rafter-pull-up-bar/">Rafter Pull-Up Bar</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">May 22, 2011</div>
    <p>I quite enjoy exercising and, ever since I did parkour, I&rsquo;ve really liked body weight movements. I don&rsquo;t do much in the way of parkour any more, but I do CrossFit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5722067913/in/photostream">religiously</a>, which features a <em>lot</em> of pull-ups.  I&rsquo;ve got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iron-Total-Upper-Body-Workout/dp/B001EJMS6K/ref=sr_1_7">doorway pull-up bar</a> which is superb for just getting going in the morning; since they&rsquo;re only $25, I think everyone should have (and use) one.  While having a pull-up bar inside the house is great, I do most of my real workouts in my garage&ndash;with easy access to running (the street), box jumps (wall in my back yard), and a barbell, I can do many different <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#General0">WODs</a>.  For WODs that involve pull-ups, I&rsquo;ve been doing them on the rafters in the garage.  While this works, the rafters are a bit too high to get to easily and they <em>really</em> strain my grip.  I&rsquo;m all for the workout being difficult, but I don&rsquo;t always want it to be training for climbing.  To that end, I built a pull-up bar this weekend.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5749073468/in/photostream"><img alt="pull-up bar" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2702/5749073468_34876074a9.jpg" width="500" height="164" class="mt-image-center" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5748521987/in/set-72157626658390219/"><img alt="bolt detail" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2160/5748521987_81c1001769_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
It&rsquo;s a pretty simple affair, largely based upon <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4vk4M-Vr5o">this instructional video</a>.  The pull-up bar runs perpendicular to a pair of rafters that are 4 feet apart, hanging a few inches below the bottom of the rafters.  In my garage, the rafters are 2x6, which seem to be plenty sturdy enough even when I kip &amp; do muscle-ups over the bar.</p>

<p>The materials I used for the bar:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 48&quot; long, 1&quot; diameter pipe</li>
<li>Two 12&quot; long 2x6s</li>
<li>Two 6&quot; long 2x6s</li>
<li>Six 4&quot; long 3/8&quot; bolts</li>
<li>Six 3/8&quot; nuts</li>
<li>Twelve flat washers</li>
<li>Eight 2.5&quot; long wood screws</li>
<li>Construction adhesive</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5748523795/in/set-72157626658390219"><img alt="bolt detail" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3430/5748523795_25a4de0930_m.jpg" width="210" height="240" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
The only prep beyond cutting the wood is drilling the holes for the bar in the larger 2x6 pieces.  Note that a 1&quot; diameter bar has a 1&quot; <em>interior</em> diameter, so you need a larger drill bit than 1&quot;; I used a 1Â¼&quot; bit which was still slightly small, but worked with a bit of extra drill action.  Once the bar holes are drilled, I made the holes for the 3/8&quot; bolts on the opposite half of the 2x6, and corresponding holes in the rafters where the bar was to be mounted.  My standard procedure for woodworking is to supplement my lackluster skill with adhesive, so I applied some construction adhesive with my caulk gun between the 2x6 and the rafter and then bolted it in place.</p>

<p>With the supports bolted in place, I slipped the bar itself through the holes and quickly discovered the need for something more.  The bar itself is 48 inches long, and the space between my rafters is also 48 inches.  Since I put the supports inside a pair of rafters, the bar was nicely flush with the outside of the supports, but this also meant it would only take a couple of inches of lateral movement for it to fall out.  The solution is to cap fashion caps using some more 2x6 and secure it with wood screws. </p>
