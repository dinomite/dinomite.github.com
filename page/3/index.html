    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 21, 2011</div>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510688763/in/set-72157626102609509/"><img alt="Finished platform" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5510688763_2a99df1c6d.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
CrossFit got me started on Olympic lifting and it is now one of my favorite things that I do in the exercise realm.  The tools needed for CrossFit are few and generally inexpensive, but Oly lifting does require some significant outlay if you plan on doing it at home.  One of the things you need is a platform upon which to perform lifts&ndash;it&rsquo;s important to have a stable, flat surface to stand on, and have the ability to drop weights.  Before going through with building a platform I dumped a light bar on my brick patio and the back yard, both of which left marks.  It was time for me to build a platform.</p>

<p>The basic arrangement of a platform is simple: a sufficiently wide patch of wood to stand on flanked by rubber to absorb dropped weights.  There are a <a href="http://straighttothebar.com/articles/2009/03/diy_how_to_build_an_olympic_we/index.html">handful</a> of <a href="http://board.crossfit.com/showthread.php?t=20752">notes</a> on building platforms online, most of which suggest two base layers made from full sheets of &frac34;&quot; plywood topped with a third half-sheet of &frac34;&quot; plywood with horestall mats on either side.  Simple enough, but these instructions also usually state that the resulting device cannot be lifted by on person alone.  I wanted to have the ability to at least flip my platform on end by myself to get it out of the way, so I took a different route.  To keep the weight more reasonable, I used 3/8&quot; (11/32&quot; at your local lumber yard) plywood and reduced the fore to aft dimension from 8 feet to 6, making for an 8 foot wide by 6 foot long platform.  In practice, this is plenty of space to perform lifts, even if you&rsquo;re doing some real speed as part of a <a href="http://crossfit.com">CrossFit</a> workout.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two 6x8 foot sheets of cheap 11/32 plywood</li>
<li>Two 4x6 foot sheets of cheap 11/32 plywood</li>
<li>One 4x6 foot sheet of nice 11/32 plywood</li>
<li>Construction adhesive</li>
<li>150 &frac34; inch wood screws</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly is a very simple affair:</p>

<ol>
<li> Lay the 6x8 sheets with their long edges side by side (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510660609/in/set-72157626102609509/">photo</a>)</li>
<li> Apply construction adhesive to half of 6x8 sheet pair and top with one of the 4x6 sheets</li>
<li> Drill &amp; screw edges every 6 to 10 inches, and put screws all over the interior as well&ndash;it&rsquo;s OK to put screws anywhere, as you won&rsquo;t be standing on this portion</li>
<li> Top with weights to ensure layers bond evenly  (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510661483/in/set-72157626102609509/">photo</a>)</li>
<li> Apply adhesive to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5511260930/in/set-72157626102609509/">other half</a>, top with remaining 4x6 sheet, and repeat screwing process</li>
<li> Test fit 4x6 piece of nice plywood in the center of the previously assembled parts and mark edges</li>
<li> Apply adhesive to the platform between marks, lay nice plywood down and secure with screws along front &amp; back (4 foot) edges only</li>
<li> Put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510663107/in/set-72157626102609509/">crapton of weights</a> on top to ensure your platform comes out flat</li>
<li> Once everything is dry, give it a coat of deck sealant to make it waterproof</li>
</ol>

<p>The end result is a platform that can (just barely) be dragged by one person.  If I were doing this whole thing again, I&rsquo;d take one more foot off of each dimension, making for a 5 by 7 foot platform and saving significant weight in the process.  I think this would sill leave enough room for any sort of lifting. </p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2011/04/09/watching-ipad-applications/">Watching iPad Applications</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Apr  9, 2011</div>
    <p>Shortly after the release of <a href="http://www.thedaily.com">The Daily</a>, <a href="http://waxy.org">Andy Baio</a> created <a href="http://thedailyindexed.tumblr.com">The Daily: Indexed</a> and, more importantly, described how he created that index in <a href="http://waxy.org/2011/02/how_i_indexed_the_daily/">a blog post</a>.  The crux of his reverse engineering of The Daily app was <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com">Charles</a>, which he describes how to use in the aforementioned blog post.  Since reading that post, I&rsquo;ve wanted to explore a number of applications on my iPad and iPhone to see what they&rsquo;re really doing when they cause the network indicator to spin.</p>

<p>First things first, I setup Charles and started up <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, an RSS feed reader that integrates tightly with Google Reader.  My main interest was to see when it actually marked posts as read&ndash;I often read in short spurts on my iPhone, which results in pulling up a post only to switch out of Reeder or lock my phone seconds later.  Sometimes the posts would be marked read if I pulled up Google Reader, but sometimes they were still marked unread.  Was this a network latency problem when the phone was using 3G/Edge internet, or was it Reeder doing some fanciness with when it marked posts read?</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to my goal right away because the first thing I noticed upon starting up Reeder is that it hits the original blog for every single one of the feeds that I subscribed to in Google Reader.  As someone who hasn&rsquo;t cleaned up a number of blogs that don&rsquo;t post anymore, this was a few hundred feeds.  I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised by this, as it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense for Google to pull all of the content for all of those blogs and package it up for my convenience.</p>

<p>Getting back to my initial focus, Reeder attempts to mark a post read as soon as you open a post&ndash;any failure of a post being marked read is because the network was slow or inoperative at the time you were reading.  Reeder periodically refreshes all of your feeds, as indicated by the spinning icon on the iPad or the replaced battery display on the iPhone, but it actually spends much longer doing this than the icon&rsquo;s state would lead you to believe.  From day-to-day usage the update to the feeds I care about (read: those that actually have updates) is done in short order, but Charles reveals that Reeder is still pulling data from individual websites.  My guess is that Reeder pulls the feed list from Google, gets the new posts mentioned therein, and then proceeds to do its own checking of feeds.</p>

<p>Reeder was the only app that had really crossed my mind after Andy Baio&rsquo;s post, and it fulfilled my desire to experiment with Charles, which is a very good tool that I&rsquo;ll turn to if I have future questions that need answering. </p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar  7, 2011</div>
    <p>There are a <a href="http://nomnompaleo.com/post/3397688384/curried-beef-broccoli-slaw-mushroom-frittata">number</a> of <a href="http://www.norcalsc.com/index.php/post/egg_cupcakes_to_go/">recipes</a> for <a href="http://everydaypaleo.com/2010/03/24/egg-cupcakes/">paleo</a> <a href="http://paleoblocks.blogspot.com/2010/08/breakfast-muffins.html">muffins</a>, which are a great way to get fast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet">paleo</a> food in the morning.  As I usually do with cooking, I created my own recipe from the ones I found online.  For 24 muffins, I assembled:</p>

<ul>
<li>18 eggs</li>
<li>5 small sausages (breakfast size)</li>
<li>2 large sausages</li>
<li>1 red pepper</li>
<li>1 large onion</li>
<li>&frac12; cup strained yogurt (Greek style)</li>
</ul>

<p>The odd sausage arrangement is simply because that is what I had on hand&ndash;once cooked and crumbled it was about 2 &frac12; cups worth of sausage.</p>

<p>I began by cooking the sausage, followed by sautÃ©ing the diced onion &amp; pepper in the fat that rendered out of the sausage.  After cracking all of the eggs into a a large bowl, I whisked them together with the yogurt.  With all of that assembled, I combined the sausage with the pepper &amp; onion and portioned it into a pair of muffin pans.  The eggs are the last thing before the oven, filling each cup &#8532;rds full.  Into the oven for 15 minutes, rotate top/bottom pan, and give them another 7-10.  The bottoms of mine were a bit under cooked, so I might try putting the lower rack all the way down, rather than the standard in-the-middle. </p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2011/02/20/altering-many-directories-at-once-with-cmddirs/">Altering many directories at once with CmdDirs</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 20, 2011</div>
    <p>On any machine I use I create a directory, sandbox, at the root of my home directory to hold checkouts of source code I&rsquo;m working on.  This directory often contains code from many different repositories, dozens of projects that I intermittently work on.  Many of these repositories depend on others, in particular Java submodules for <a href="http://clearspring.com/">Clearspring</a>, and I want to be able to easily update all of them at once.  With Subversion this is easy: the <code>svn</code> command allows you to act upon a checkout without being in the directory that contains it.  Simply issuing <code>svn up *</code> from <code>~/sandbox</code> ensures that I have the latest code revision in each of my checkouts and <code>svn st *</code> allows me to see if I have any uncommited changes.</p>

<p>While I love Git, it does not make such actions this simple.  Git requires you to be in the repository directory (or set a number of environment variables) to work wit that repo.  While the <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/235455/bash-script-to-perform-an-action-on-each-subdirectory-in-a-directory"><code>-exec</code> option of <code>find(1)</code></a> allows me to descend into each directory and perform an action, I wanted to make this easy, because such all-checkout-actions are something that I want to do a number of times each day.  Like most problems, this one is (best?) solved with Perl.  Enter <a href="https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs">App::CmdDirs</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs/raw/master/bin/cmddirs">CmdDirs</a> is a fairly simple Perl app that I have written to do what I describe above&ndash;descend into any number of directories and perform a command in each one.</p>

<pre>titus:~/sandbox$ ls
CmdAll                 mac-itunes             genius-os
scoreboard             GAE                    hf
uaParser               WebService-LOC-CongRec iTunes-Sync
titus:~/sandbox$ cmddirs "git st"
Performing `git st` in &lt;cmdall&gt;
## master
?? App-CmdDirs-1.00.tar.gz

Performing `git st` in &lt;itunes-sync&gt;
## master

Performing `git st` in &lt;uaparser&gt;
## master
 M uaParser/test/test_user_agent.py

Performing `git st` in &lt;webservice-loc-congrec&gt;
## master
</pre>

<p>See the numerous directories? Note that there are 9 directories in my <code>sandbox</code> but <code>git st</code> was only performed in a few of them, those which are Git repositories.  CmdDirs has a modicum of intelligence: if it knows what your command is, the command will only be performed in applicable directories.  This can be overridden with <code>-all</code>, <code>-git</code>, or <code>-svn</code> doing what you expect.  Git and Subversion are the only two things supported right now, because that&rsquo;s all I have a need for. Writing new <a href="https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs/tree/master/lib/App/CmdDirs/Traverser">Traversers</a> is simple&ndash;just copy the form of git.pm or svn.pm.  You can probably Achieve at this endeavor even without knowing Perl.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a one-liner for installing <code>cmddirs</code>:</p>

<pre>
curl https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs/raw/master/bin/cmddirs > ~/bin/cmddirs && chmod a+x ~/bin/cmddirs

    <p><a href="http://mpierce.org/gallery/v/motorsport/2010-12-lemons/2010-12-lemons-00012.jpg.html"><img alt="The Jaywatch car" src="http://mpierce.org/gallery/d/4339-2/2010-12-lemons-00012.jpg" width="400" height="267" class="mt-image-left" /></a>
<a href="http://www.nccbmwcca.org/content.php?120-driving-school">Drivers&rsquo; schools</a> are incredibly fun and the best way to improve your driving prowess.  <a href="http://www.nasaproracing.com/hpde/">Track days</a> can be incredibly useful for honing your skill once you have been on track enough to catch your own mistakes.  While incredibly useful tools for learning to drive fast, neither can touch the <a href="http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/">24 Hours of LeMons</a> for having fun with motorsports.  I have previously written about <a href="http://dinomite.net/2010/how-bvd-skidmark-got-to-goin-for-broken/">the basics of getting to a LeMons race</a>, and what happened at <a href="http://dinomite.net/2010/bvd-skidmarks-first-24-hours-of-lemons/">our first race</a>.  The team just finished another race, the 2010 Arse-Freeze-Apalooza at Buttonwillow this past weekend, where we finished 68th of 173.  Better than half made us happy, because the head gasket blew with an hour and a half left in the race.</p>

<p>Track driving is certainly a specialized skill and racing is a step beyond that&ndash;in addition to driving a car at the limit, you have to deal with numerous other cars on track who may decide to pass you at any time.  In crapcan racing things are even crazier because most folks don&rsquo;t care much if the car gets hit and many of them have little to no experience driving on a racetrack, much less in anger.</p>

<h1>Track Experience</h1>

<p>The biggest piece of advice I can give is to get some track experience before heading out on track in your first LeMons race.  Street driving, or even autocross shares very little with driving on a racetrack, and there is no adequate preparation aside from sufficient time on a track.  Even if you have done a lemons race, going to a much less crowded HPDE or other track even twill be very information&ndash;rare are the times you get to take an unmolested line, much less lap, at a race.</p>

<h1>Many Races</h1>

<p><a href="http://mpierce.org/gallery/v/motorsport/2010-12-lemons/2010-12-lemons-00097.jpg.html"><img alt="F'ed Up Racing" src="http://mpierce.org/gallery/d/4509-2/2010-12-lemons-00097.jpg" width="400" height="267" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
The first time you go to a 24 Hours of LeMons event, you&rsquo;ll find at least three different types of race teams: those who built something that doesn&rsquo;t belong on a racetrack; the teams there to win; and the teams that are just there to have fun in any way possible.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, everyone is there to have fun, but the former two have very specific goals in mind.  The folks who bring a <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/12/and-the-real-winner-is-2/">Fiat 600</a> or a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43812942@N06/5233878618/in/set-72157625406524427/">limousine</a> aren&rsquo;t interested in winning the race outright&ndash;they&rsquo;re looking for the <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5068138/index-of-effluency-bar-set-unreasonably-high-for-thunderhill-peugeot-505-turbo-or-chevy-corvair">Index of Effluency</a>, or simply testing their own mechanical mettle.</p>

<p>By the same token, some teams come with the intent to win the speed race&ndash;they have a reliable, quick car, know how to do fast pit stops, and don&rsquo;t intend to spend time in the penalty box.  If it&rsquo;s not obvious who these teams are, check the time sheets after a couple hours of racing; they are the ones on the lead lap or just behind.  Figure out which cars belong in this group, do your best to stay out of their way, and certainly don&rsquo;t hit them.</p>

<h1>Caution Wave</h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve done other racing or track days, one of the first things you&rsquo;ll notice about crapcan racing is the number of yellow flags thrown.  When you have hundreds of $500 cars on a racetrack with inexperienced drivers, problems happen often.  At the Arse-Freeze-Apalooza, Jay said that the recovery crew did 75 tows on Saturday alone.  Oftentimes, cautions will be thrown well ahead of what you can see if you&rsquo;re closely following a pack of cars.  For this reason, you&rsquo;ll see folks who have been racing a while throw up their hand by the rear-view mirror and wave when they see a yellow flag.  This way, everyone behind knows that they are going to slow for caution, and you should too.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2010/12/01/creating-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu/">Creating an OpenVPN Server on Ubuntu</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Dec  1, 2010</div>
    <p>I have long used an <a href="http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/12/08/ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-forwarding-secure-browsing/">SSH tunnel</a> (put simply: <code>ssh -D 8000 server</code> + <a href="http://getfoxyproxy.org/">FoxyProxy</a>) to browse the web <a href="http://codebutler.com/firesheep">securely</a> from unencrypted wireless access points and other <a href="http://www.wallofsheep.com/">potentially hostile networks</a>.  While this is secure, it isn&rsquo;t all that convenient and <a href="http://sites.inka.de/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">has inherent problems</a>.  What I really want is a proper VPN, that will seamlessly encapsulate <strong>all</strong> traffic from my local machine and pass it through the tunnel to be emitted by the server.  <a href="http://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> is one of <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">those things</a> that has a reputation for being difficult to setup,so I long avoided it.  Once I decided to actually make with the go, it turned out to not be terribly difficult, though I did have to do a bit of searching to get exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>There are a number of <a href="http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/304510:weekend-project-setting-up-a-vpn-on-your-linux-router-or-gateway">good</a> <a href="http://www.itsatechworld.com/2006/01/29/how-to-configure-openvpn/">tutorials</a> for setting up OpenVPN, and the following instructions will mostly mirror those.  First, install the requisite packages:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
caligula:~$ sudo aptitude install openvpn
</pre>

<p>Then, setup a place to generate the requisite keys:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~$ mkdir tmp/vpn && cd vpn
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ cp -r /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0/* .
</pre>

<p>At this point, many tutorials (the above mentioned ones included) say that you should run <code>./init-config</code>, which doesn&rsquo;t exist in recent version OpenVPN.  With the scripts for generating keys in place, open up <code>vars</code> and edit the stuff at the bottom, which should be pretty straightforward:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
    export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
    export KEY_PROVINCE="NY"
    export KEY_CITY="Rochester"
    export KEY_ORG="Dinomite-Net"
    export KEY_EMAIL="drew@dinomite.net"
</pre>

<p>The <code>vars</code> file just sets up a bunch of environment variables, so you&rsquo;ll want to source it and then build the certificate authority:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ source vars
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./clean-all
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-ca
</pre>

<p>Building the certificate authority involves a few questions, for most of which the defaults defined from <code>vars</code> are all you need.  Next, build the keys for the server and client (I name my computers <a href="http://dinomite.net/2009/caligulas-giant-ship/">after Roman emperors</a>):</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-key-server caligula
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-key vespasian
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-dh
</pre>

<p>With all that done, you can copy the appropriate key files over to the client, in my case <code>vespasian</code>.  Since I already had <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/">tunnelblick</a> on that machine, I put the files directly where they needed to go:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ cd keys
caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ scp vespasian.crt vespasian.key \
    ca.crt vespasian:~/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations/
</pre>

<p>Two steps left.  First, make the client configuration file.  For tunnelblick, this goes in the same directory as above, and you can name it whatever you want:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
    vespasian:~$ cat Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations/client.conf
    client
    dev tun
    proto udp
    remote caligula.dinomite.net 1194
    resolv-retry infinite
    nobind
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    ca ca.crt
    cert vespasian.crt
    key vespasian.key
    comp-lzo
    verb 3
</pre>

<p>There are plenty of other sites that will explain what all of those options mean, so I won&rsquo;t go over it here.  The important things to change from above are the <code>remote</code> and the names for the <code>cert</code> and <code>key</code>.  Now on to the server config and the files that it needs:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ cp dh1024.pem caligula.key caligula.crt /etc/openvpn/
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ cat /etc/openvpn/server.conf
    server 10.7.7.0 255.255.255.0
    push "redirect-gateway"

    dev tun0
    proto udp
    keepalive 10 120
    comp-lzo
    dh /etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem
    ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
    cert /etc/openvpn/caligula.dinomite.net.crt
    key /etc/openvpn/caligula.dinomite.net.key

    status /var/log/openvpn-status.log
    verb 3

<p>The secret sauce in that config is <code>push &quot;redirect-gateway&quot;</code> which is what tells the client to route all of its traffic through the tunnel to the server.  To make this work, the server needs to be set up to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a>:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.7.7.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it!  Just restart the server (<code>sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn restart</code>), connect, and all your traffic is now safely encrypted to the server. </p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 20, 2010</div>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been doing autocross and track days with my 1997 BMW M3 for long
enough that I can offer some insight into the brake pads available for
E36 M cars.  What follows are the brake pads that I have driven, in
order of heat handling. If you only drive on the street, the top of
the list is where you want to be. If you have a race car, the bottom
is your domain.</p>

<h2>EBC Greenstuff</h2>

<p>An awesome street pad, thanks to producing much less dust than stock.  I drove these pads at my very first HPDE with the <a href="http://www.nccbmwcca.org">National Capital Chapter</a> of the <a href="http://bmwcca.org">BMW CCA</a>; the track is not their forte. By the end of the second day, I had burned through &frac34; of the pads, and the car was putting out clouds of smoke braking into turn 1 on Summit Point&rsquo;s main circuit. Unsurprisingly, this was accompanied by significant fade.</p>

<p>Like stock pads, these will work for your first track experience if you are conservative, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it. Thanks to their low dust, EBC Green Stuff work great for street pads and even the
occasional autocross.</p>

<h2>Hawk High Performance Street (HPS)</h2>

<p>The HPS are biled as a stock-replacement pad and I would agree with that.  They dust a bit less than BMW OEM pads, and provide a little bit more fade resistance.  For track use, the HPS is much like stock or the EBC Greenstuff mentioned above&ndash;they&rsquo;ll work if you&rsquo;re new &amp; conservative or slow.</p>

<h2>Axxis Ultimate (ULT)</h2>

<p>These are quite similar to the HPS&ndash;less dust than stock, good feel even when stone cold, and a bit more heat handling capability than stock.  They work great for street driving and autocrossing, but are only good for limited (read: slower) track use.</p>

<h2>Hawk High Performance Plus (HP+)</h2>

<p>The HP+ are a good compromise between track and street pads.  I recently used them for a fade-free weekend at Thunderhill with ambient temperature of 70-80F.  Unlike a full-on track pad that is downright scary on the street, the HP+ is decidedly OK on the street.  The first stop of a drive (or after not using them on the highway for a few minutes) will be a bit longer than stock pads, but not the Flintstones feeling of track pads.</p>

<h2>Hawk Blue</h2>

<p>I am lazy, so I put my pads on at home before driving to the track, so I got to experience these on the street.  To begin with, the first stop from neighborhood speeds takes about twice the distance you expect, and the initial bit is nonexistent.  After a couple more low speed stops, the brakes have enough heat to work just fine, but they still squeal as though you are murdering cats with each brake application.</p>

<p>On the track, the Hawk Blue is an awesome pad.  Being a true track pad it takes some heat before they really work, as described above.  Just like you need to get your tires and brain up to temperature, with a track pad you need some heat in the brakes before they will do what you expect.  You should be driving judiciously on your out lap anyway, so this ought not be a problem.  The wear on these is much better than any of the aforementioned pads&ndash;a day at Laguna Seca burned less than one quarter.  If you have been going to the track for a while, or if you&rsquo;ve gotten fast enough to begin feeling fade in your existing brake setup, get some track pads. </p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Oct 26, 2010</div>
    <p>Like many folks, I have a desktop that I use for most of my computing, and a laptop that I use while travelling, at a coffee shop, or perhaps while <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2745228,ihnatko-multitasking-twitter-internet-092510.article">watching tv</a>.  The other thing I have is a lot of music, all nicely rated and organized in iTunes. The problem is that new music I get goes onto my desktop, but I would like to have the exact same stuff on my laptop.  Enter <a href="http://github.com/dinomite/iTunes-Sync">iTunes-Sync</a>, a simple script that I wrote to synchronize the iTunes library file and all of the content (music, etc.) that it depends upon between the two machines.  </p>

<p>Using iTunes-Sync is simple:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
laptop:~/$ perl itunes_sync.pl dinomite 192.168.1.100
</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it.  The script copies the <code>iTunes Library</code> file wholesale, and uses <code>rsync(1)</code> to pull over the album art, mobile applications, and music directories.</p>

<p>I only care about getting everything from my desktop to the laptop&ndash;if you want to go both ways, or perhaps preserve metadata changes made on the laptop the process will be a bit more involved.  Before you use your laptop, close iTunes on both machines, and then run iTunes-Sync from the laptop.  Go out and have fun.  When you get back, close iTunes on both machines and run iTunes-Sync from the desktop.</p>

<p>You can get iTunes-Sync on <a href="http://github.com/dinomite/iTunes-Sync">GitHub</a>; the only thing you need is the <a href="http://github.com/dinomite/iTunes-Sync/raw/master/itunes_sync.pl">itunes_sync.pl</a> file itself. </p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2010/10/14/tough-mudder-norcal-2010/">Tough Mudder Norcal 2010</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Oct 14, 2010</div>
    <p>On October 9th, I ran the <a href="http://toughmudder.com/events/northern-california/bear-valley-course-map/">Northern California Tough Mudder</a>.  Billing itself as &ldquo;the TOUGHEST one day event on the planet&rdquo;, Tough Mudder is an endurance race helad at a number of venues throughout the United States.  The event is basically a trail run punctuated by obstacles.  Except there aren&rsquo;t many trails involved&ndash;the terrain covered is largely rock washes and barren mountain.  <a href="http://toughmudder.com/events/">Most of the locations</a> are ski resorts, perfect because they offer challenging ground with significant elevation change to add difficulty.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryandoherty/5065905645/"><img alt="Crossing the finish line" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5065905645_acd88fec4e.jpg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
As they say at the start line, this isn&rsquo;t your average trail run, mud run, obstacle course, triathlon, or marathon.  In my mind, Tough Mudder is one of many things that could be considered what <a href="http://www.crossfit.com">CrossFit</a> is all about.  The Norcal event took place at <a href="http://www.bearvalley.com">Bear Valley Mountain Resort</a>, which ranges in elevation from about 7,000 feet up to 8,500 feet.  The start of the run was near the bottom, leaving us to go up and down the entirety of that 1,500 vertical feet twice.  In the midst of that, obstacles ranged from crawling under low wire or through tubes, to being assaulted with freezing cold water from snow machines.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d say the hardest parts of Tough Mudder were the elevation and the running in total.  Having not done the event before, it&rsquo;s hard to know what it will be like.  My expectations were for a demanding obstacle course with some significant running in between.  As mentioned above, I would now describe it in the opposite order: a very difficult trail run with some obstacles along the way.</p>

<p>The preparation advice on the Tough Mudder site can be a bit hard to parse and leaves a lot of questions, so here&rsquo;s my stab at it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do CrossFit or join an elite military unit; little else that can adequately prepare you for such a demanding event</li>
<li>This is not a marathon; being a running twig won&rsquo;t get you through Tough Mudder in a reasonable time</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mechanix.com/automotive/the-original-glove">Mechanix Gloves</a> which are fairly light, durable, and form fitting are a very good choice</li>
<li>Wear normal workout or outdoor clothes&ndash;you&rsquo;ll get dirty, but not ripped up</li>
<li>If you have an older pair of sunglasses, wear them</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about carrying water, it will be provided on the course every few miles</li>
<li>Walk on the right, run on the left: slowing down is fine, but please stay out of the way of the more dedicated folks</li>
<li>The water will be cold, nothing can change that</li>
</ul>

<p>So how did I do?  Well, Tough Mudder makes a big point of saying, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an event, not a race&rdquo;.  I started in the 12:00 group, which gave me a chance to watch the first group, which started at 10:00 and included the most elite runners, begin to finish at 11:16.  I went into my group knowing that 1 hour 16 minutes was the time to beat.  I crossed the finish line at 13:43, putting me at 1 hour 43 minutes.  I discout this a bit because I spent 5 minutes or so waiting to do the spool-jumping obstacle, and nearly 15 minutes waiting at the mud-run obstacle because the pommel horse jumping was backed up.  I&rsquo;m confident in saying that my correct time was about 1:25.</p>
