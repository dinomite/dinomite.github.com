    <p>This is the synopsis of <a href="http://www.2600.com/offthehook">Off The Hook</a> that aired on <a href="http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0308.html">5 March 2008</a>.</p>

<p>In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Redbird, Not Kevin
On the phone: Bernie S in Philadelphia</p>

<p>Emmanuel credits last weeks record donations to the Lego kits that were given as premiums and promises many Legos at the <a href="http://www.thelasthope.org/">HOPE conference</a> this year.  Pre-registration for the conference is open.</p>

<p>Mike brings up the case brought against <a href="http://wikileaks.org">Wikileaks</a> by <a href="http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Bank_Julius_Baer">Bank Julius Baer</a> that caused the California-based registrar that registered the domain wikileaks.com, <a href="http://www.dynadot.com/">Dynadot</a>, to de-register the name.  The Swiss bank with ties to the Cayman Islands has since dropped their suit against Wikileaks after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect</a> brought more press to the issue than it would have gotten had they simply left Wikileaks alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a British man running a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/05/us_kills_european_based_cuba_websites/">travel agency specializing in trips to Cuba</a> has had a number of his domain names, <a href="http://www.ciaocuba.com">ciaocuba.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bonjourcuba.com">bonjourcuba.com</a> among others, de-registered because they were bought through an American registrar, <a href="http://enom.com">eNom</a>.  The man was recently added to the Treasury department's list of <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sdn/sdnlist.txt">Specially Designated Nationals</a> which consists of persons who deal with organizations and countries that the United States finds unsavory.</p>

<p>Emmanuel mentions a new law in New Jersey law which makes talking on cellphones and two-way radios illegal but has an exemption for amateur radio operators.</p>

<p>The German constitutional court has struck down a law allowing investigators to install spyware on suspects' computers.</p>

<p>FBI director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller">Robert Mueller</a> has announced that a DOJ report will show that FBI investigators abused <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">national security letters</a> using them to obtain information from banks, telephone and internet providers under circumstances that did not warrant their use.</p>

<p>Pakistan has blocked access to YouTube because the video site posted a blasphemous video.  After being told that routers were probably used to block the site the head of the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority said, "We are not hackers, why would we do such a thing?"</p>

<p>Digital television is coming in 2009.  In order to use non-digital TVs with the new over-the-air digital signal a converter box must be used.  Vouchers for the boxes can be obtained from <a href="https://www.dtv2009.gov/">dtv2009.gov</a>.  The group speculates that the changeover won't go smoothly at all.</p>

<p>One out of 99 American adults is in prison, with a total of 1.6 million prisoners in the company.  The United States leads the world in incarceration rates.</p>

<p>Phone calls - 212.209.2900
Letters - oth@2600.com</p>

<p>A listener who hosts a show on <a href="http://frolympia.org">Radio Free Olympia</a>, a pirate radio station in Washington writes in to praise Off The Hook.</p>

<p>A caller says that he saw NYPD vehicles using what are presumably automatic license plate scanners that resemble spotlights in their vehicles.  He says that they drive slowly through neighborhoods, presumably to scan all the plates of parked cars.  Bernie has an idea to print out the license plates of most wanted criminals and posting them where the police scan in order to slow down such automated scanning.</p>

<p>A caller asks about receiving digital television signals from Jersey.  Despite having a large antenna in his attic, he is unable to receive the digital version of a channel that he receives fine in analog.  Bernie notes that the UHF frequencies for digital TV are higher than those for analog and so the antenna might not be tuned properly.</p>

    <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

    <p>If you try to <code>rsync</code> from a Mac OS X machine using the <code>-E</code> switch (capture extended attributes &amp; resource forks - you want this) to a Linux or BSD computer, you'll get something like the following error:</p>

<pre>
rsync: on remote machine: -vlogDtprzE: unknown option
rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1108)
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-30/rsync/io.c(359)
</pre>

<p>What's the holdup?  Well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork">resource forks</a> are a purely Mac OS construct (though NTFS has <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1822">Alternative Data Streams</a> that aren't often used) allowing specific data, such as icons and application metadata, to be <a href="http://vafer.org/blog/20080215024239">shoved into a file</a>.  The standard version of <code>rsync</code> doesn't support these containers, so Apple includes a patched version in Mac OS X to handle them and in order to get this support on a non-Mac, you must install this patched version.  Doing so is a fairly simple affair, since Apple makes the patch readily available through their <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/">Darwin source site</a>.</p>

<p>Since I'm running Mac OS 10.5.2 (the latest update to Leopard), the files I need are in the 10.5.2 branch of the <code>darwinsource</code> directory; change that number to your version of OS X or navigate from the above mentioned Darwin source site.</p>

<pre>
wget http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.2/rsync-30/rsync-2.6.3.tar.gz \
http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.2/rsync-30/patches/EA.diff
</pre>

<p>Don't ask me why the directory is <code>rsync-30</code> when they're using <code>rsync-2.6.3</code>.  Now it's just a simple matter of unpacking the source, applying the patch and compiling <code>rsync</code>:</p>

<pre>
tar zxf rsync-2.6.3.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd rsync-2.6.3 &amp;&amp; patch &lt; ../EA.diff &amp;&amp; \
./configure --enable-ea-support &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</pre>

<p>By default, it installs to <code>/usr/local/bin/rsync</code> so installing this version won't trash that put in place by your sytem's package manager.  I also found a post on <a href="http://macosxhints.com">macosxhints.com</a> concerning <code>rsync</code> interacting with the disk indexing of Spotlight.  If you are writing tons of files to a Spotlight-indexed disk on a Mac, the indexer can become overwhelmed.  The solution is to disable Spotlight on the disk in question with <code>mdutil -i off &lt;mountpoint&gt;</code> or to write into a directory appended with <code>.noindex</code>.</p>

<p>Emmanuel plays a clip from 30 November 1999 where Amy Goodman was covering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO_Ministerial_Conference_of_1999_protest_activity">WTO protests</a> in Seattle, which he cites as the beginning of the independent media movement on the internet.  He relates a story of Shapeshifter, 2600's layout artist, who was arrested in Philadelphia after police saw him talking on a cell phone and accused him of organizing the protests.

    <p>When you install Mac OS X, it asks you for your full name, which is what it will use for what it calls the username.  Despite calling it the username, it is not actually field 1 in <code>/etc/passwd</code>, which is what Unix users would call the username.  Mac OS X refers to the first field of <code>/etc/passwd</code> as a user's "short name," normally a concatenated and lowercased version of your full name.  As one would expect, your Unix username, what you would use to login at a console or via SSH, is actually the short name; your files are stored in /Users/<shortname> and are owned by <shortname>.</shortname></shortname></p>

<p>Like many Unix users, I have a username (dinomite) that is different from my real name (Drew Stephens) and I like it that way.  Having a username on one machine that doesn't match that on all of my others is a hassle, requiring me to specify a username whenever I SSH to or from said machine.  After having reinstalled OS X recently I wanted to change my short name on the system to rectify this problem.  Though some tutorials make it seem like an <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106824">involved process</a>, it's actually fairly straightforward if you have some Unix and OS X experience.  Here's how I did it in 10.5 (Leopard).</p>

<p>First, you must enable the root user; we will make all the username changes while logged in as root.  You could also login as another user and use sudo (hint: <code>sudo -i</code>) to do this, but I had no other users on my machine.  To enable root, open Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Directory Utility, then click the lock in the Directory Utility window and enter your username &amp; password.  Choose "Enable Root User" from the Edit menu and supply a password for root when prompted.</p>

<p>Now that root is enabled, log out of your own account, click "Other…" in the login window and supply root's credentials.  Once logged in, we need to create a the new user with the desired short name.  Open System Preferences and select the Accounts pane.  Add a new user by clicking the '+' at the bottom and fill in the Name &amp; short name fields as desired; I used a temporary name (Drew) and the short name I wanted (dinomite), since you can't have two identically named users and the name can be easily changed later.</p>

<p>Open a terminal (Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal) and change to /Users.  <code>ls</code> ought to show directories for both your current short name and the newly created one.  Now you just have to move your files from your old short name to the new one: <code>mv &lt;old short name&gt;/* &lt;old short name&gt;/.* &lt;new short name&gt;/</code>.  Once that completes, you need to change the ownership to the new short name: <code>chown -R &lt;new short name&gt; /Users/&lt;new short name&gt;</code>.  Since everything is now in the new users' domain, you can now delete your old username, log out of root and log in using your newly short named account.</p>

    <p>Someone asked me questions about filesystems recently and, though I used to have a good handle on them, my knowledge has waned over the years.  I figured writing about filesystem internals was a good way to brush up on that knowledge.</p>

<p>This information applies generally to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_File_System">UFS</a>, FFS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2">ext2</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3">3</a> and XFS.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS">ReiserFS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System">HFS</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">+</a>) employ B-trees for organization of file metadata rather than inode lists, so they are somewhat different.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> is the tits and all of its shenanigans are handled differently.</p>

<p>At a low level, Unix filesystems are made up of three main pieces on the disk: a superblock, inodes and data blocks.  The superblock contains information about the filesystem: a magic number to identify the type, the size of the filesystem, free data blocks and other gross information.  After the superblock comes a list of inodes, each of which contains metadata about a file including the permissions, the number of links to the file, the file type (symlink, directory, etc.) and the datablocks that hold the actual file data.   Note the conspicuous lack of a filename in the inode; more on this later. The balance of the space on a partition is made up of those data blocks which hold the actual file data.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, inodes only store metadata; the actual data is stored in one or more data blocks, the inode merely keeps a list of the blocks that contain the data for the file.  In ext2/3, each inode has 15 blocks that can each refer to a single data block, each of which is usually 1 kilobyte meaning that the maximum filesize on ext2 is 15 kilobytes…but that's certainly not true.  The 15 data-referencing blocks are actually allocated more intelligently than that.  The first 12 (0..11) are direct blocks, pointing to the first 12 blocks (kilobytes) of a file.  The 12th block is the indirect block; instead of pointing to data blocks that contain data, it points to a data block that contains a list of up to 2060 addresses of blocks that contain data.  Since a maximum filesize of (2060+12) 2072 kilobytes isn't sufficient for most peoples needs, the 13th block is doubly-indirect and the 14th is triply-indirect.  With all that indirection, the maximum filesize on ext2/3 is about 35 gigabytes, which ought to be enough for anyone.</p>

<p>So, when you want to read a file, the operating system first checks the metadata in the inode to ensure you have permission to access said file.  Assuming you do, data is pulled from the data blocks listed in the inode, with appropriate indirection depending upon the size of the file.</p>

<p>I mentioned previously that filenames are not part of the inode, which seems odd as the filename seems to be a type of file metadata.  The rub is that in POSIX systems a file can have multiple names; my home directory can be referred to as <code>/home/dinomite</code>, <code>/home/dinomite/.</code>, <code>/home/dinomite/bin/..</code> or a number of other names.  How is this handled and where are filenames actually put?  In directories.  A directory boils down to nothing more than a list of names and their associated inode numbers, which we refer to has a link, giving name to the system call <code>unlink</code> which most people refer to as delete.  When you refer to a file by name, the operating system starts at the root node (<code>/</code>), which is always inode number 2.  Beginning with the root directory listing, it matches filenames to inode numbers, cascading this lookup until it has found the file that you referenced.</p>

<p>The important thing mentioned in the previous paragraph is that filenames in a directory list are links to a file; each of those links is noted in the file's inode as the link count.  Whenever a file is given a name (either by being created or a hard link via <code>ln</code>), the link count is incremented; when a link is deleted, the link count is decremented.  When the link count reaches zero, the kernel releases those data block, unless the file is currently open.  In the latter case, the data blocks are freed when the file is closed.  This also lends insight into how undelete programs work and what computer people mean when they say deleting something doesn't actually get rid of the data on the disk.  When you delete a file, more properly known as unlinking it, the only thing that actually goes away is the data in the inode.  Until they are overwritten, the data blocks still contain the data prior to being deleted.  <code>fsck</code> works in a similar manner, searching for inodes that have positive link counts, but no references in directories.</p>

<p>Finally, there are symbolic links.  With a symlink, an inode is allocated and has its symlink bit set.  If the file pointed to by the symlink is 60 bytes or less, it is stored directly in the inode.  If its longer, the pointed-to file is stored in data blocks and they are pointed to by the inode in the normal fashion.  Note that symbolic links to not affect an inode's link count, hence broken links.</p>

<p>In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Not Kevin<br />
On the phone: Bernie S from Philadelphia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman">Mitch Altman</a> from California</p>

<p>Another week of fundraising.</p>

<p>RIM's Blackberry service <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/11/Outage-knocks-BlackBerry-users-offline_1.html">had another outage</a> between 3:30pm and 6pm on Monday but the company claims that no data was lost.</p>

<p>Not Kevin's Verizon Samsung phone went on the fritz and throwing it from a ten-story building didn't fix it.  Emmanuel reports that, upon trying to SMS Not Kevin after he obtained a new phone, receive a response stating that the phone was unreachable, even though it was on.</p>

<p>This week brought many news stories of persons crossing the United States border and <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/02/us_customs_seiz.html">having their computers more than thoroughly inspected</a> or even seized by <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> or <a href="http://www.cbp.gov">U.S. Customs and Border Patrol</a> employees.  The searches include confiscation of laptops and cellular phones, forcing users to divulge their passwords and in some cases wholesale copying of data of disks or SIM cards.  Emmanuel advocates United States citizens refusing these searches.  A number of blog posts on the web have suggested keeping a secondary account on your laptop with some fake data, in order to comply with the search request without actually divulging data.  Bruce Schneier still recommends <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-199.html">employing strong encryption techniques</a> to protect your data.  Bernie S proposes the use of tiny memory cards, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroSD">MicroSD</a>, for storing ones data and hiding it when crossing the border.  The <a href="http://www.eff.org">EFF</a> is <a href="http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=47090">suing to stop the practice</a>.</p>

<p>The Senate <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00015">voted on a bill</a> to give retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy">warrantles wiretapping</a>.  Noted votes are those of potential presidential candidates; John McCain voted YEA to grant immunity, Barack Obama voted NAY and Hillary Clinton was (strategically) not present for the vote.  The bill passed with 61 YEA votes, including all Republicans and <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/002448.html">a number of Democrats</a>.</p>

<p>Network neutrality has come up again as Barack Obama spoke about it in a podcast from two years ago.  Obama advocated the continuation of net neutrality, a de-facto policy that has been in existence since the beginning of The Internet.  The senator chastised cable and telephone companies for being against network neutrality and also spoke in support of increased competition in broadband access.  Much like her failure to vote in the above-mentioned issue, Hillary Clinton has been conspicuously silent about net neutrality, despite her numerous speeches covering technology issues.  John McCain is on the record against net neutrality instead leaving it to the market to decide; the problem with such a stance is the duopoly that most consumers are left with for high speed access.  Mike Huckabee is in favor of net neutrality, explaining his position with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes">an analogy involving trucks on a highway</a>.</p>

<p>A clip from February 15th, 1995, the day Kevin Mitnick was captured, is played.  Emmanuel discusses the situation surrounding Kevin at the time and his near-miss capture a few weeks prior.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Abene">Phiber Optik</a> made an appearance discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Poulsen">Kevin Poulsen</a>'s case.</p>

<p>Mitch relates a story of a TV crew following him around Paris, France as he walked around turning off TVs.</p>

<p>Emmanuel mentions the real-world protests of <a href="http://xenu.net">Scientology</a> by "Anonymous"; in New York, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2008/02/11/nyc_scientology.php">more than 200 people were present</a>.  Another demonstration will take place on the 15th of March at Scientology sites throughout the world.</p>

    <p>My friend Lex read my post on <a href="http://dinomite.net/archives/dictatorial-leadership-is-sometimes-the-best">Python's lack of switch statements</a> and sent me a note that the normal method for implementing something along the lines of a <code>switch</code> in Python is to use a dictionary.  First, let's define some functions:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">
def fooFunc():
    print 'Got foo?'
def barFunc():
    print 'Not foo.'
def nomatch():
    print 'No function to speak of!'

string = 'foo'
</pre>

<p>Now we can create a dictionary and just lookup the variable you want to switch upon:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">
# Make a dictionary and call it switch
switch = {
    'foo': fooFunc,
    'bar': barFunc
    }

# Find the string in the dictionary, thereby calling the function
switch[string]()
switch['bar']()

# Another way to do the dictionary lookup
switch.get(string, nomatch)()
switch.get('bar', nomatch)()
</pre>

<p>Which will call the function in the switch dictionary, or call <code>nomatch</code> if none of the dictionary entries match.  Or create an anonymous dictionary and do it all at once, more like a traditional <code>switch</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">
{
    'foo' : fooFunc,
    'bar' : barFunc
}[string]()
</pre>

<p>Bernie S clarifies the rules regarding promotion of business on public radio; though one is allowed to speak well of a business, you cannot compare it to other business.</p>

<p>Redbird mentions the <a href="http://www.intelius.com">Intelius</a> database, a background check service, which will give you a persons date of birth before you have to pay.</p>

<p>The group discusses London's expansion of their automated congestion charging to tally high polluting vehicles as well.</p>

<p>Emmanuel plays a clip from a November 1999 show and discussion of the upcoming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K">Year 2000 Problem</a>.  Emmanuel laments people who think that 1999 is the last year of the century or that 2000 is the first year of the new millennium.  Micro controllers that control municipal functions are brought up, in particular the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>s (not micro controllers) that control the release of sewage into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River">East River</a> according to lunar cycles, which influence tides.</p>

    <p>John McCain's economic advisor, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, was on <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/01/30/econ_advisors_holtz_eakin/">Wednesday's Marketplace</a> discussing the senator's economic strategy for the country.  In the interview, Holtz-Eakin said this of McCain:</p>

<blockquote>
He is a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution. He saw President Reagan cut taxes within the context of budget discipline and controls on spending.
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to say that McCain had seen the positive effects of Reagan's policies of lower taxes on the economy and that the senator supported such actions.</p>

<p>Excuse me?  Are we really still bringing up Reagonomics?  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics">trickle-down economics</a> championed by the Reagan administration is a contentious issue and its effects on the general populace, like that of all economic matters, is debatable.  One thing that isn't debatable, however, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_by_U.S._presidential_terms">size of the federal debt</a>.  To put it quite frankly: Republicans want to cut taxes and spend like there's no tomorrow.  Ideally such a policy should be a boon to the economy and yet there's no clear evidence for that being the case.  What such strategies do affect are programs like Social Security; the money for tax cuts has to come from somewhere and more often than not it is by marginalizing other Federal programs.  Don't get me wrong, I don't particularly care for Social Security but the fact of the matter is I pay into it and I want to get my money's worth.  As it stands, I may never see the 6% of my pay that goes toward the troubled fund.</p>

    <p>In attendance: Emmanuel, Bernie S, Mike, Redbird and Not Kevin.</p>

<p>Bernie mentions that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System">analog cell phone service (AMPS)</a> will be shut off during the week of February 18th.</p>

<p>The entire crew makes note of their significant lack of sports knowledge in light of the upcoming Superbowl.  Emmanuel shows a surprising amount of knowledge, though he condemns this knowledge wishing he could replace it with useful information in his head.</p>

<p>The show is on <a href="http://bloggasm.com/january-30th-is-international-delete-your-myspace-account-day">International Delete Your MySpace Account Day</a> and Emmanuel points to it as evidence of the power of blogging and wonders whether.  Redbird insists that Facebook is useful and MySpace is not, though he admits to possibly having a MySpace account.  He also brings up the <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/01/myspace_torrent">flaw in MySpace's private pictures</a>, which allowed pictures marked private to be viewed by anyone.  Emmanuel longs for an antonymous version of Facebook where people create lists of enemies and Bernie says that someone named "Bell" had an online death-pool but was arrested and the site taken down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hope.net">The Last Hope</a> will be July 18-20th and more information will be on the website.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.charter.com/Visitors/Home.aspx">Charter Communications</a> accidentally deleted messages for 14,000 email accounts and claims the data is completely irrecoverable leaving all very surprised that Charter didn't have backups for the data.  Redbird is impressed that Charter didn't simply blame the loss on hackers.</p>

<p>Also not caused by hackers is the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/01/27/2008-01-27_empire_state_building_car_zap_mystery.html">Bermuda triangle of car problems</a> around the Empire State building.  Purportedly connected to cars with keyless entry, including Emmanuel's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(automobile)">Smart Car</a>, a New York City towing company says that they have to move 10-15 cars in the neighborhood per day.  Usually, they claim, towing the car a few blocks away solves the problem.  Redbird notes that the radio transmitters on top of the building are powerful enough that they will interfere with all sorts of radio devices.</p>

<p>A woman was awarded <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/24/america/24sentence.php">nearly the maximum sentence for her crime</a> after making light of her victim's death on a prison phone.  Bernie said that when he was a guest in Federal prison all calls were recorded and there are no provisions for private calls, even with one's attorney.</p>

<p>Bernie brings up <a href="http://www.qwest.com">Qwest</a>'s refusal to participate in the NSA's warrant-less wiretaps over the past few years but mentions that they lost numerous Federal contracts because of this decision.</p>

<p>Estonia and Russia are in a conflict over the movement of a World War 2 memorial in Estonia.  Apparently the Russia government was not involved in attacks against Estonian government and business websites rather it was a young Estonian angered by his government's decision on the memorial.</p>

<p>The group discusses <a href="www.partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology">Anonymous' Project Chanology</a> whose attacks have been successful in bringing attention to the cult of <a href="http://xenu.net">Scientology</a>.  Bernie relates a story from when he worked as an offset printer.  The owner of the business for which he worked was a Scientologist who tried to convert Bernie who was fired from the job after not joining the crazies.</p>

<p>Though Google <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070125-230048.php">changed their algorithm</a> to reduce the incidence of Google Bombs, if you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=dangerous+cult&amp;btnG=Search">search for</a> "<a href="http://www.scientology.org">dangerous cult</a>" the first hit is the website of The Church of Scientology.  In other news, the cast of Off The Hook is often equipped with <a href="http://www.2600.com/offthehook">blank expression</a>s.</p>

<p>Jim is still recovering and is now in a nursing home.  His address is:</p>
<blockquote>
Caton Park Nursing Home<br />
Attn: Jim Vichench<br />
1312 Caton Avenue, Rm. 312B<br />
Brooklyn, New York 11226<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Bernie says that Jim can now read again but still has trouble writing.</p>

<p>A listener wrote in to say that he saw a <code>robots.txt</code> which made mention of significant fines and lawsuits for people using automated methods of grabbing websites.  The consensus is that one couldn't get sued for using <code>wget</code>, but given the <a href="www.circleid.com/posts/811611_david_ritz_court_spam/">zone transfer decision</a> made recently, care should be used when using automated tools to grab websites.</p>

<p>Apparently OTH has a bunch of 80+ year old listeners.</p>
