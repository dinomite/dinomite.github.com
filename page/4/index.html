    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 28, 2010</div>
    <p>Phil Zuckerman, a <a href="http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/">sociology professor</a> at <a href="http://www.pitzer.edu">Pitzer College</a> and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Society-without-God-Religious-Contentment/dp/0814797148">Society Without God</a>, an analysis of religiosity and its effects on a society.  Zuckermand gave a talk at the annual <a href="http://ffrf.org">Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> convention in 2009, highlighting many of the important statistics he analyzed for the book, which I will paraphrase below, using the section headings from his speech.  As Zuckerman himself says, these are merely correlationsâ€”his prime aim towards Americans is to make clear that a lack of religion does not hinder a society.</p>

<h2>Atheists are better educated</h2>

<ul>
<li>Only 7% of members of the <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org">National Academy of Sciences</a> claim a belief in a personal god.</li>
<li>While 27% of Americans claim &ldquo;no religion&rdquo;, 42% of college graduates are in the irreligious cohort.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Atheists are less homophobic and more moral</h2>

<ul>
<li>60% of religiously unaffiliated Americans support gay marriage compared with only 26% of Protestants and 42% of Catholics.</li>
<li>Among secular Americans, support for the invasion of Iraq was 38%, compared with 68% of evangelical Protestants, 58% of Catholics, and 47% of Jews.</li>
<li>Nonreligious Americans support stem cell research much more (84%) than those who report being &ldquo;very religious&rdquo; (55%) or &ldquo;somewhat religious&rdquo; (76%).</li>
<li>The US prison population consists of only 0.2% atheists.</li>
<li>Murder rates are lowest in the more secular states, and highest in the most religious.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Atheists in concentration results in societal success</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s see the rates of residents reporting &ldquo;no faith&rdquo; in states.</p>

<p>Highest:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oregon (31%)</li>
<li>Washington (30%)</li>
<li>Vermont (30%)</li>
<li>Colorado (26.6%)</li>
<li>Delaware (26.5%)</li>
<li>Idaho (25.4%)</li>
<li>California (25%)</li>
<li>New Hampshire (24.5%)</li>
<li>Wyoming (24.2%)</li>
<li>Montana (23.7%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Lowest:</p>

<ul>
<li>North Dakota (9.3%)</li>
<li>South Dakota (10.2%)</li>
<li>Mississippi (11.5%)</li>
<li>Alabama (12.3%)</li>
<li>Tennessee (13.5%)</li>
<li>Maine (14.5%)</li>
<li>Texas (15.4%)</li>
<li>North Carolina (15.4%)</li>
<li>Louisiana (15.5%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some statistics using those numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rate of religiousness and murder rates are inversely correlated; the highest rates are found in Louisiana and Alabama while the lowest are in Vermont and Oregon.</li>
<li>The poverty rate is similarly related to the proportion of atheists, with the most poor people in Mississippi and Tennessee, while the fewest in poverty are found in New Hampshire and Hawaii.</li>
<li>Mississippi has the highest obesity rate at 31.6%, followed by West Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana, and South Carolina; the lowest rates are in Colorado (18.4%), Hawaii, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont.</li>
<li>Infant mortality and teen pregnancy show similar trends; STD rates are highest in the Bible Belt where college graduation rates are also the lowest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where I Stand</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the side of the statistics, which show stronger societies are those with less religion.</p>

    <p>Recently, I wanted to respond to <a href="http://twitter.com/peasleer/status/8136443388">a friend&rsquo;s tweet</a>
with a <a href="http://twitter.com/dinomite/status/8138332322">specific quote</a> from The Big Lebowski.  While there are a number of Big Lebowski scripts around
the internet, none of them provide markup to allow linking to sections of the script.  With the
help of some simple Perl, I created a version of the script with anchor tags throughout, making it
easy to point someone to a specific scene from the film.  <a href="http://dinomite.net/~dinomite/lebowski.html">Check it

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2009/12/25/using-the-shell-right/">Using The Shell Right</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Dec 25, 2009</div>
    <p>The most powerful part of Unix/Linux/BSD is the command line.  In stock trim, the Unix shells are all very effective, but your time can be more effective by customizing the shell.  I use <code>bash</code>, so I know that these things work in that shell, but they ought to be easily transferred to others as well.</p>

<h2>Aliases</h2>

<p>A good friend of mine, <a href="http://semicomplete.com">Jordan Sissel</a>, once said that if you do something more than once, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.  His conjecture applies as much to your shell as it does to your <a href="http://dinomite.net/2008/smart-bookmarks">browser</a>â€”computers are great at repetitive tasks, so you shouldn&rsquo;t bore yourself with such things.  Therein lies the most important thing you can do with your shell: make common tasks easier with aliases.</p>

<p>First things first, I use <code>ls</code> a whole lot, and, despite it&rsquo;s simple makeup, I often mistype the command.  I don&rsquo;t care about being able to easily run <a href="http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/games/sl.html">Steam Locomotive</a>, and there&rsquo;s no <code>s</code> or <code>l</code> command, so I replace those all with <code>ls</code>:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">alias sl=&quot;ls&quot;
alias l=&quot;ls&quot;
alias s=&quot;ls&quot;
alias ll=&quot;ls -l&quot;
alias lh=&quot;ls -lh&quot;
alias la=&quot;ls -la&quot;</pre>
Another thing I do all the time is descend into directories, which means I need to get out of them, too:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias ..=&quot;cd ..&quot;
alias ...=&quot;cd ../..&quot;
alias ....=&quot;cd ../../..&quot;
alias .....=&quot;cd ../../../..&quot;
alias ......=&quot;cd ../../../../..&quot;
alias .......=&quot;cd ../../../../../..&quot;
</pre></p>

<p>I always want extended regular expressions, and there are tons of things I don&rsquo;t want to search when I grep (though I use <a href="http://betterthangrep.com">ack</a> these days):</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias grep="egrep"
alias G="grep -n --color=always --binary-file=without-match --exclude=tags \
--exclude=*-min.js --exclude-dir='.[a-zA-Z]*' --exclude-dir='external' \
--exclude-dir='blib'"
</pre>

<p>Furthermore, I often want to do recursive greps of a entire codebase, sometimes case insensitive, and like everything else, I mistype it:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias GR=&quot;G -r&quot;
alias RG=&quot;GR&quot;
alias GRI=&quot;G -r -i&quot;
alias GIR=&quot;GRI&quot;
alias IGR=&quot;GRI&quot;
alias IRG=&quot;GRI&quot;
</pre></p>

<p>If you do any sort of system administration, you need to grep the process list; make that easy:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias paux=&quot;ps aux|grep -i&quot;
</pre></p>

<p>Is someone shoulder surfing?
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias c=&quot;clear&quot;
alias logout=&quot;clear; logout&quot;
</pre></p>

<p><a href="http://asktherelic.com">Matt Behrens</a> tipped me off to this oneâ€”<code>type -a</code> tells you a lot more than the standard <code>which</code>:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias which=&#39;type -a&#39;
</pre></p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m writing in a language that requires compilation, I use cowsay to break up the output of each run, so that errors are easy to distinguish between this run and the previous one:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias gcc=&#39;cowsay &quot;Hello&quot;; gcc&#39;
alias g++=&#39;cowsay &quot;Hello&quot;; g++&#39;
alias make=&#39;cowsay &quot;Hello&quot;; nice -n 10 make&#39;
alias javac=&#39;cowsay &quot;Hello&quot;; javac&#39;
</pre></p>

<p>Machines that I SSH to often get their names as aliases; I&rsquo;ve got a bunch more of these:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias claudius=&quot;ssh -Y dinomite@dinomite.net&quot;
alias caligula=&quot;ssh -Y dinomite@caligula.dinomite.net&quot;
</pre></p>

<h2>Prompt</h2>

<p>There are numerous articles about pimping out your shell&rsquo;s prompt, many include previous command exit codes, the time, the current energy of the LHC, and the price of the S&amp;P 500.  I have a web browser, so I don&rsquo;t need all that informationâ€”I only put in my prompt things that are pertinent to the task at hand.  The things that make up my prompt are a bit complicated, so I build it in stages.  First, since I work on a lot of different machines, I always have the hostname in my prompt.  To make it easy to tell which machine I&rsquo;m on, I assign colors to the systems that I use most often:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
HOSTNAME=`hostname|sed -e 's/\..*$//'`
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'Caligula' ] || [ $HOSTNAME = 'Caligula.local' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;35m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'claudius' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;36m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'dev1' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;34m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'svr-dev-rw1' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;31m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'drewfus' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;30m\]"
fi
</pre>

<p>Next, I capitalize the hostname and make the colon separating it from the path red if I&rsquo;m currently acting as root via <code>sudo -s</code>.  This makes it very hard to forget that the consequences of actions are great at the current time:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
COLON_COLOR='0m'
if [ ${UID} -eq 0 ]; then
    COLON_COLOR='1;31m'
fi
if [ ${UID} -eq 0 ]; then
    HOSTNAME="`echo $HOSTNAME|tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'`"
fi
</pre>

<p>Finally, build the actual prompt:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
PS1=`echo -ne "$HOST_COLOR$HOSTNAME\[\033[00m\]\[\e[$COLON_COLOR\]:\[\033[33m\]\
w\[\033[00m\]\\[\033[01;33m\]\$\[\033[00m\] "`
</pre>

<p>What does this look like?<br>
<span style="color: #00ccff;">claudius</span>:<span style="color: #339966;">/usr/local$</span><br>
And when root:<br>
<span style="color: #00ccff;">CLAUDIUS</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #339966;">/usr/local$</span></p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>There are a lot of complicated commands that I only use occasionally; having a big history means if I&rsquo;ve used it once, I can easily search and find the command later.  The <code>histappend</code> options tells bash to append rather than overwrite the history file and <code>cmdhist</code> combines multi-line history commands into a single entry.  It&rsquo;s often useful to run the same command repeatedly, and I find myself typing <code>ls</code> whenever I stop to think; setting <code>HISTCONTROL</code> and <code>HISTIGNORE</code> keeps those actions from filling up my history.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
#"I know I've used that command before, but I can't remember the syntax"
export HISTSIZE=50000
shopt -s histappend
shopt -s cmdhist
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
export HISTIGNORE="&:ls:ll:la:lh:sl"
export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S - '
</pre>

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<p>A lot of linuxes come with lackluster program defaults (emacs, more, etc.); you can get better ones by setting environment variables:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
export PAGER=/usr/bin/less
export EDITOR='vim -X'
export BROWSER='firefox'
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
</pre>

<p>Since we are in the 21st century, I use Unicode:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
export LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8"
</pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>I use Perl a lot, and have to deal with keeping modules the same across different systems; this function makes getting the installed version of a module easy:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
function perlmodver {
    perl -M$1 -e 'print "Version " . $ARGV[0]->VERSION . " of " . $ARGV[0] . " is installed.\n"' $1
}
</pre>

<p>The thing I use <code>awk</code> for most often is &rsquo;{print $n}&rsquo;, so I wrote <a href="http://dinomite.net/2009/fawk/"><code>fawk</code></a> which you give a number and it des just that:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
function fawk {
    first=&quot;awk &#39;{print &quot;
    last=&quot;}&#39;&quot;
    cmd=&quot;${first}\$${1}${last}&quot;
    eval $cmd
}
</pre></p>

<p><code>awk</code> also does math:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
function calc {
    awk &quot;BEGIN{ print $* }&quot;;
}
</pre></p>

<h2>Tying It All Together</h2>

<p>To keep things organized, I separate the above mentioned things into a few different files, so my <code>.bashrc</code> brings them all together.  Additionally, I check for a <code>.bash_local</code> file, which isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://dinomite.net/2008/keeping-your-home-directory-in-subversion/">checked into subversion</a>, so that I can have machine-specific alterations to my shell environment.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
# .bashrc
source ~/.bash_global
source ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bash_functions
if [ -f ~/.bash_local ]
then
    source ~/.bash_local
fi
</pre>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2009/11/17/screen-presets/">Screen Presets</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 17, 2009</div>
    <p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScreenProfiles">Screen Profiles</a> package taught a lot of folks about how GNU Screen can be so much more than a fancy replacement for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup">nohup(1)</a>.  Since GNU Screen&rsquo;s name is difficult enough to search for, they have thankfully renamed the package to <a href="https://launchpad.net/byobu">Byobu</a>.  Byobu provides users with a whole bunch of pre-defined aliases to make working within Screen easier, and make more sense by defining a useful status line.  There&rsquo;s more that can be done with screen, the most notable in my view is creating predefined working environments that make getting yourself up and running when logging into a system easy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a number of different things that I commonly do where I want a number of different screen windows: running the deamons on our development server, connecting to the DB servers in each of the different environments, and developing an experimental project.  For each of these applications, I have created a screenrc that I keep in my <code>.screen/</code> directory; the basic format is this:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
source $HOME/.screenrc

sessionname daemons
chdir /code/htdocs/dstephens/trunk/webroot/daemons

screen -t 'CONTROL' bash
screen -t 'aggregator' bash
screen -t 'autoEventWatcher' bash
screen -t 'emailReady' bash
screen -t 'sfUpload' bash
screen -t 'jmsCommandExecutor' bash
screen -t 'bouncedEmail' bash
select 0
</pre>

<p>First, I source my global <code>.screenrc</code>, which includes setting a statusline, larger scrollback buffer, multiuser and utf8.  Next, giving the session a name makes it easier for me to figure out which one to reattach to later. Finally, I create and name all of the windows that I want to have in my session, in this case, one for each of the daemons that I want to be able to run.</p>

<p>To run a specific preset, just invoke screen with the <code>-c</code> option: <code>screen -c ~/.screen/daemons</code>.  Easy.</p>

    <p>With the help of <a href="http://mrooney.blogspot.com/">Mike Rooney</a>, I created a plugin for <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a> that shows quotes from <a href="http://www.schneierfacts.com/">Bruce Schneier Facts</a>: the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/BruceSchneier+Plugin">BruceSchneier plugin</a>.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Sep 28, 2009</div>
    <p>When walking through Ikea one day, I spotted the perfect bottles in which to make Skittles vodka.  Starting with these, here is the process for making this infusion.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964554487/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Skittles vodka materials"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2465/3964554487_50b848e127_m.jpg" alt="Skittles vodka materials" width="240" height="122" /></a> 
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1300 grams of Skittles [$18 at Costco]</li>
    <li>4 liters of vodka [$60 at Costco]</li>
    <li>Five 1 liter bottles [$25 at Ikea]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Paper towels</li>
    <li>Colander</li>
    <li>Funnel</li>
    <li>1 liter bowl</li>
    <li>5 bowls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964553495/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Sorting Skittles"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2585/3964553495_544ab42731_m.jpg" alt="Sorting Skittles" width="240" height="158" /></a>
The first tedious part of this process is sorting the Skittles into their various colors (ostensibly, flavors).  I sat down in front of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Singapore_Grand_Prix">Singapore Grand Prix</a> with six plates: one for each of the five Skittles colors and an extra on which to dump packages for sorting.  I bough a box of 36 normal-size (61 gram) packages of Skittles from Costco and ended up using 22 of the packs.  To sort them, I poured a few packages onto one of the plates and separated the candies onto the five others.</p>

<p>After consulting <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Shoot-the-Rainbow-Skittles-Vodka/">other</a> who had <a href="http://mixthatdrink.com/skittles-vodka-tutorial/">made Skittles vodka</a>, I settled on needing 240 Skittles per liter of vodka.</p>

<p><br>
<h2>Assembly</h2>
Now comes the easy part.  To get the Skittles into my narrow-mouthed bottles, I made a simple paper funnel and carefully poured the candies in.  Easy.  Then, I just used my liquid funnel to fill each bottle with vodka.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964551461/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="The assembled Skittles vodka team"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2536/3964551461_2316f38122_m.jpg" alt="The assembled Skittles vodka team" width="240" height="172" /></a> </p>

<h2>Shake and Wait</h2>

<p>After each of the containers was filled, I gave them a quick shake; within a few hours, much of the candies had dissolved.  I left them overnight, and by the next day all that was left was a small bed of white pebbles in the bottom of each bottle.</p>

<h2>Filter</h2>

<p>Finally, the filtration.  This step is the most difficult, because it requires a lot of patience even though you&rsquo;re almost done!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964546733/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Completed Skittles vodka"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2473/3964546733_0ab8c7a1db_m.jpg" alt="Completed Skittles vodka" width="240" height="128" /></a>
<p>A lot of the mass of Skittles is binderâ€”corn starch and the like.  It leaves a significant amount of scum onthe top of your Skittles vodka mix.  To strain it off, I started by using standard office coffee filters, but those clogged very quickly.  I switched to normal paper towels, which made filtering take about 5 minutes per bottle.  After filtering, re-bottle and enjoy your super-sweet vodka rainbow!</p></p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2009/07/09/internet-birthday/">Internet Birthday</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jul  9, 2009</div>
    <p>My Internet Birthday recently passed.  What is an Internet Birthday, you ask?  Why it&rsquo;s the arbitrary date that I&rsquo;ve chosen to give when a website wants to know my birthday.  You see, gentle reader, the vast majority of websites that ask for your birthday have no real reason to have it; most of the time it will simply be used for marketing.  Whether or not you really care about that relatively innocuous usage, the real danger is that a lot of legitimate, organizations such as financial institutions, hospitals, and governments, use your birthday as an identifying piece of informationâ€”as though providing such a date is a verification of the person speaking or filling out a form.</p>

<p>Because of this abuse of a fairly public piece of information for the purpose of security, it is reasonable to want to keep your date of birth somewhat secretâ€”or at least refrain from giving it to everyone who asks.  Unfortunately, many services require you to provide a date of birth when signing up; some will give you a bonus if you give them your birthday.  So as to not miss out on these services, I simply came up with a date that I use as my birthday when asked on the internet.  I no longer hesitate to provide the information asked.  Why not use a random date every time you sign up?  Sometimes, particularly if you forget your password, a website will want you to enter your birthday at a later time to verify who you are.  By choosing one date and sticking to it, you can always give the correct information.
<h2>Choosing an Internet Birthday</h2>
To come up with an internet birthday, simply choose a date!Â  Afraid you won&rsquo;t remember?Â  Understandable.Â  Choose something that makes sense to you: the first or last day of the month you were born, the day you were born modulo 12 to get a new month, or take <a href="http://cheshirecatalyst.com/birthday.html">Cheshire Catalyst&rsquo;s suggestion</a> and use the start or end date for your astrological symbol.Â  As for the year, in most cases keeping the same year as your actual birth is the easiest and effective enough for our purpose.Â  If you&rsquo;re really paranoid, then just round to the nearest half-decade
<h2>Internet Family</h2>
Cheshire has updated his essay to suggest that an internet &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s Maiden Name&rdquo; is also beneficialâ€”and I agree.Â  I have an entire family based upon characters from a movie that I use for my financial accounts.Â  If you&rsquo;re serious about security, or you just can&rsquo;t remember the surnames names of your recent ancestors, then an Internet family based upon your favorite (or not so favorite) story is a great route to take.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">May  3, 2009</div>
    <p>If you go to <a href="http://ebay.com">http://ebay.com</a> you will briefly see a naked text page with the following text, broken sentence structure and all:</p>

<pre>
The page you are looking for has been moved. If this page does not redirect you in 10 Secs,lease click here.
</pre>

<p>It will only be visible for a fleeting moment, because your browser will be redirected to <a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>.  The world&rsquo;s flea market fails the <a href="http://no-www.org/faq.php">no-www</a> test in the worst way - if you try to go to their website without a www subdomain, your are sent to said subdomain.  eBay fails in a special way; rather than simply using an Apache RewriteRule:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]
</pre>

<p>they send a web page containing an HTML <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh">meta refresh</a> to send you to <a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>.  This is a clumsy and slow way to perform a redirect, particularly for the front-page of your website.  If you are a website administrator or webmaster, please, don&rsquo;t be as hackish as eBay - embrace <a href="http://no-www.org/faq.php">Class A no-www compliance</a> or at least redirect using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection">HTTP status codes</a> rather than browser redirection.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 19, 2009</div>
    <p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3455135080/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3319/3455135080_1a853a6011.jpg" alt="Completed Zombie Defense Station" width="500" height="233" /></a></p>

<p>I have finally completed my Zombie Defense Station.Â  Inspired by <a title="Craftster Zombie Defense Station" href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=202668.0">this post</a> that made it around the internet a few months ago, my kit contains a <a title="Sig P226 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_P226">Sig P226</a> handgun, a <a title="Franchi SPAS-12 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchi_SPAS-12">Franchi SPAS-12</a> shotgun (as seen inÂ  <a title="Jurrasic Park on IMFDB" href="http://www.imfdb.org/index.php?title=Jurassic_Park#Franchi_SPAS-12">Jurassic Park</a>), and a<a title="Gerber Gator Machete" href="http://www.amazon.com/Gerber-22-41576-Gator-Machete-Sheath/dp/B000Q9BBZI"> Gerber Gator</a> machete, which looks unnecessarily evil.</p>

<p>The construction was pretty easy and consists of the following parts
<ul>
    <li>&frac14; inch beech plywood</li>
    <li>1x4 pine plank</li>
    <li>&frac12; inch pine square</li>
    <li>&frac12; inch dowel</li>
    <li>3/16 inch thick plexiglass</li>
    <li>Stencils from <a href="http://www.stencilease.com/">StencilEase</a></li>
    <li>Airsoft guns</li>
    <li>Gerber Gator machete</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3394065314/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3394065314_77242815ae_m.jpg" alt="15 inch machete saw" width="240" height="160" /></a></p>

<p>The first thing I did was get the airsoft guns and the machete, so that I could decide how big to make the enclosure.Â  I bought the SPAS-12 online at the suggestion of my roommate when I said that I just wanted an awesome looking shotgun.Â  We then trekked to various stores in the area in search of machetes.Â  After turning up empty handed at OSH, Home Depot, and Target we hit the jackpot in Sports Authority&rsquo;s camping section.Â  For some reason, Gerber makes, and Sports Authority carries, this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3394065314/">15 inch, saw-back machete</a>.Â  While I think it is absolutely unnecessary for camping purposes, the Gerber Gator is a great zombie knife.</p>

<p>I settled on 34 inches long and 15 inches high, since that fit the SPAS-12 nicely with room for the machete underneath.Â  I cut the box perimeter, screwed it square, and then screwed the back of the box to that.Â  I affixed some 3.5 inch long pieces of &frac12; inch pine square to the corners, upon which the plexiglass would later rest.Â  To mount the guns, I used some 2 and 3 inch long pieces of &frac12; in dowel that are screwed in place from the back of the box.Â  The machete is held in place by some small metal hooks that I got in the Home Depot hardware aisle.</p>

<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3406616916/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/3406616916_4a23319e58_m.jpg" alt="15 inch machete saw" width="240" height="116" /></a></p>

<p>After the box was all assembled, I tossed a coat of gray paint on the inside, and bright red around the perimeter.Â  I cut a piece of 3/16 plexiglass with a razor knife (doesn&rsquo;t work very well - is there a better way?) and stenciled it using the stick-on stencils I orderd from <a href="http://www.stencilease.com/">StencilEase</a>.Â  To put the plexiglass into place, I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/3M-Scotch-Removable-Mounting-Squares/dp/B001B0D46K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=office-products&amp;qid=1240125975&amp;sr=8-3">3m Removable Mounting Squares</a>.</p>

<p>My house is now safe from zombie attacks.</p>
