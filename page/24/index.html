    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 17, 2006</div>
    <p>So, I'm pretty high in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">self-efficacy</a>; I am very confident in my own abilities and my aptitude for learning new skills and information.  I look at things like <a href="http://www.wrc.com">WRC</a> or <a href="http://www.formula1.com">Formula 1</a> and think, "With some practice, I could definitely do that," which is my assesment of most things I come across.  Overconfident isn't a far off descriptor for me at times.  Occasionally, though, something comes along that totally shatters my belief in my own skills and simply leaves me in awe of someone's knowledge or talents, such as this video of a guy <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6283096511750618839">performing a choreographed juggling routing with 5 balls</a>.  Seeing this video left me speechless and I have immense respect for that guy.  When you break it down, those are all moves that, with some practice, most people could be taught to do.  Stringing them together into a 5 minute routine choreographed to music without a single dropped ball is entirely another story.  Wow.</p>

<p>Edit: So apparently the guy is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garfield">Jason Garfield</a>, a professional juggler.  Given that juggling is his occupation, it's a lot more understandable; I'm still amazed at his skill.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 16, 2006</div>
    <p>Must we be congratulated for the simplest of tasks performed on the internet?  I just left feedbeack at eBay and was applauded for doing so.  If memory serves, most web stores praise you for making a purchase.  If you're going to congratulate me, at least send a medal along with the thanks.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/03/14/trivial-internet-payments/">Trivial Internet Payments</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 14, 2006</div>
    <p>I want to be able to pay for simple services on The Internets, say running a few searches on a subscription site, without having to shell out for their full subscription service.  Earlier today I wanted to look up some restaurants in Zagat's guide which, like everything these days, has interweb-searchability but, because they are a commercial entity, using said service requires having a subscription.  This is something where, right now at least, I don't want to sign up to use it for a month as I only want to run a couple of searches and paying $20 to use it for a day is a waste.  There should be some system by which I can pay per search or buy a short time period to access the site, worth less than a dollar.</p>

<p>Such payments, which are trivial to consumers who would barely think twice about paying for services all over the web once setup with the service, could net business like Zagat's online arm or Consumer Reports online searching functionality a significant amount of money.  There must be other people out there who have wanted to use a service for a short period, but don't care enough to sign up for a full subscription.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 27, 2006</div>
    <p>About a month ago a guy <a href="http://windowsxp.onmac.net/The%20Contest.html">started a site</a> to collect donations and build a pool of money that would be given to the first person to get Windows XP runing on the new Intel-based Macs.  In the intervening time, some development progress has been made but overall it's been quite slow.  The hold up is that Windows has forever been designed to run on a machine with a standard BIOS that was designed way back when…  Basically, the Intel Macs initiate the boot process in a wholly different manner than all x86 PCs have previously.  This different booting strategy has been the real holdup in getting Windows to run on the otherwise fairly standard hardware and it looks like last week someone <a href="http://windows.onmac.net/2006/02/21/the-windows-installer-loaded-on-an-imac/">got past that hurdle</a>, booting into the Windows installer.  With that, I'd say we're nearing the time when Windows will run on Macs, a glorious day indeed.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 26, 2006</div>
    <p>Do you administer or use unix systems remotely?  Ones that log you out if you're idle for long enough?  <a href="http://www.laffeycomputer.com/spinner.html">Spinner</a> is a program that runs in the background and periodically sends characters to keep your session from going idle.  Cool.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 24, 2006</div>
    <p>I was browsing around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">my favorite interwebsite</a> and I noticed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_with_titles_that_don't_appear_in_the_lyrics">this page</a> .  Ok, so maybe not everything on Wikipedia is useful…</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 19, 2006</div>
    <p>So, I knew it was going to be cold on Thursday when the NPR 5 minute news brief, which sticks to big stories like terrorists taking control of Israel or massive protests by fundamentalists, had a guy from the National Weather Service on saying, "This is going to be the first arctic air burst we've had all year; it's going to be quite cold."

    <p>I'm not really a fan of Jay Leno, but this quote about the whole Cheney shooting incident was very, very good; kudos to his writers.</p>

<p>"What a nightmare I had last night. I dreamed I was at a Washington party and I had to choose between Dick Cheney taking me on a hunting trip or Ted Kennedy driving me home." –Jay Leno</p>

<p>This came from a page with a list of <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blcheneyquotes.htm">jokes made about Cheney</a> since back in the first term.  It also links to a couple of great clips from The Daily Show on shooting:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://movies.crooksandliars.com/TDS-Cheney-Shotg.mov">Dick Cheney shoots friend while hunting</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://movies.crooksandliars.com/com_tds_cheney_s.mov">Downgrading the funniness because Whittington had a heart attack</a></li>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 10, 2006</div>
    <p>I noticed a lot of network and forking activity while using my computer last week, thanks to <a href="http://members.dslextreme.com/users/billw/gkrellm/gkrellm.html">GKrellM</a>  I checked around and noticed a constant series of hits in my auth.log from someone trying common names to login via SSH.  I blocked the offender, but from looking through the log, this happened quite often and, though I have very strong passwords, this was very annoying to me to see all that crap in the logs.  I searched around and found a daemon called fail2ban that simply watches the logs and blocks hosts who have more than a specified number of failed login attempts.  It's in the Debian repositories, so just <code>apt-get install fail2ban</code> and then configure it in <code>/etc/fail2ban.conf</code>.</p>

<p>I also saw some cool tips on the <a href="http://wiki.clug.org.za/index.php/Defending_Against_Brute_Force_SSH_Attacks">CLUG Wiki</a>.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  9, 2006</div>
    <p><a href="http://www.sonicdrivein.com/index.jsp">Sonic</a>, the fast food chain self-proclaimed "America's Drive-in," which, I guess is true; it's the only drive in I know of this side of Oklahoma.  I'm not much for fast food, but I quite enjoy Sonic, probably only because of the novelty, as I only get it on my way to the Outer Banks, NC.  What confuses me is their advertising scheme.  The only place I've ever seen Sonic locations is in southern Virginia and beyond; indeed, the farthest north location on their website is in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Yet I see their television advertisments in D.C.  And in Rochester, fully 550 miles from Williamsburg.  Why do they advertise here, again?</p>
