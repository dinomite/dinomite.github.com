    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 24, 2006</div>
    <p>My social psychology teach counseled his students in the great benefit that goals can have on mood, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem">self-esteem</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">self-efficacy</a>, the latter being much more important in light of recent studies.  Accomplishing goals, however small, has a great positive effect upon one&rsquo;s feelings of self worth (self-esteem), motivation and ability to achieve (self-efficacy).  In this light, he implored everyone to create to-do lists every day, outlining everything you plan to do.</p>

<p>Really, you want to include as much as possible, within reason.  Something like &ldquo;get out of bed&rdquo; probably doesn&rsquo;t belong on a list, but &ldquo;go to the gym&rdquo; is a good goal.  If you see breakfast as standard fare, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be on the list, but if you&rsquo;re one to normally skip the day&rsquo;s prime meal and want to change, it ought ot be on your list.  As silly as some goals seem, even eating breakfast, achieving a goal has great positive psychological effects, as mentioned above.  Be warned however, that failing to achieve a goal has inverse effects.  In that light, creating goals that aren&rsquo;t trivial but at the same time aren&rsquo;t too much of a stretch is the best thing to do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, having a list of huge goals that are very long in the making should be somewhere else; putting &ldquo;build kit car&rdquo; on your daily list won&rsquo;t do anything good but keep that un-achieved objective present in memory.  If you are building a kit car, perhaps you want to get the bottom end assembled this weekend or install a couple of control arms today.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 22, 2006</div>
    <p>Intel&rsquo;s latest big chip, the Pentium Extreme Edition 965, costs just over a thousand dollars and yet it still <a href="http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2006q1/pentium-xe-965/index.x?pg=4">looses out</a> to the AMD&rsquo;s not-quite-top-of-their-line Athlon 64 X2 4800+ which can be had for around $650 (the Athlon 64 FX-60 is their range-topper).  The biggest discrepencies are seen in gaming benchmarks, which is particularly sad because gamers are the biggest market for such hugely expensive chips.</p>

<p>In short, Intel&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBurst">NetBurst</a> architecture still sucks; for their sake, I hope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_Microarchitecture">Core</a> is as fast as they purport.  Until then, as the state has been for the past few years, buy AMD.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 19, 2006</div>
    <p>I wrote a little program to print some statistics about your iTunes library while watching the Malaysian GP today.  It doesn&rsquo;t really do the whole XML thing, and only prints a couple of things that iTunes itself won&rsquo;t tell you, but It&rsquo;s a start of something that could be good.  Right now it will tell you which artists and genres you have the most songs of, the average length of songs in your library and their average size.</p>

<p>Update: Now produces output based upon how many times tracks have been played, which was really the point of this whole thing.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 17, 2006</div>
    <p>So, I&rsquo;m pretty high in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">self-efficacy</a>; I am very confident in my own abilities and my aptitude for learning new skills and information.  I look at things like <a href="http://www.wrc.com">WRC</a> or <a href="http://www.formula1.com">Formula 1</a> and think, &ldquo;With some practice, I could definitely do that,&rdquo; which is my assesment of most things I come across.  Overconfident isn&rsquo;t a far off descriptor for me at times.  Occasionally, though, something comes along that totally shatters my belief in my own skills and simply leaves me in awe of someone&rsquo;s knowledge or talents, such as this video of a guy <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6283096511750618839">performing a choreographed juggling routing with 5 balls</a>.  Seeing this video left me speechless and I have immense respect for that guy.  When you break it down, those are all moves that, with some practice, most people could be taught to do.  Stringing them together into a 5 minute routine choreographed to music without a single dropped ball is entirely another story.  Wow.</p>

<p>Edit: So apparently the guy is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garfield">Jason Garfield</a>, a professional juggler.  Given that juggling is his occupation, it&rsquo;s a lot more understandable; I&rsquo;m still amazed at his skill.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/03/16/congratulations/">Congratulations!</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 16, 2006</div>
    <p>Must we be congratulated for the simplest of tasks performed on the internet?  I just left feedbeack at eBay and was applauded for doing so.  If memory serves, most web stores praise you for making a purchase.  If you&rsquo;re going to congratulate me, at least send a medal along with the thanks.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/03/14/trivial-internet-payments/">Trivial Internet Payments</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 14, 2006</div>
    <p>I want to be able to pay for simple services on The Internets, say running a few searches on a subscription site, without having to shell out for their full subscription service.  Earlier today I wanted to look up some restaurants in Zagat&rsquo;s guide which, like everything these days, has interweb-searchability but, because they are a commercial entity, using said service requires having a subscription.  This is something where, right now at least, I don&rsquo;t want to sign up to use it for a month as I only want to run a couple of searches and paying $20 to use it for a day is a waste.  There should be some system by which I can pay per search or buy a short time period to access the site, worth less than a dollar.</p>

<p>Such payments, which are trivial to consumers who would barely think twice about paying for services all over the web once setup with the service, could net business like Zagat&rsquo;s online arm or Consumer Reports online searching functionality a significant amount of money.  There must be other people out there who have wanted to use a service for a short period, but don&rsquo;t care enough to sign up for a full subscription.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/02/27/windows-xp-on-intel-macs/">Windows XP on Intel Macs</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 27, 2006</div>
    <p>About a month ago a guy <a href="http://windowsxp.onmac.net/The%20Contest.html">started a site</a> to collect donations and build a pool of money that would be given to the first person to get Windows XP runing on the new Intel-based Macs.  In the intervening time, some development progress has been made but overall it&rsquo;s been quite slow.  The hold up is that Windows has forever been designed to run on a machine with a standard BIOS that was designed way back when&hellip;  Basically, the Intel Macs initiate the boot process in a wholly different manner than all x86 PCs have previously.  This different booting strategy has been the real holdup in getting Windows to run on the otherwise fairly standard hardware and it looks like last week someone <a href="http://windows.onmac.net/2006/02/21/the-windows-installer-loaded-on-an-imac/">got past that hurdle</a>, booting into the Windows installer.  With that, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re nearing the time when Windows will run on Macs, a glorious day indeed.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 26, 2006</div>
    <p>Do you administer or use unix systems remotely?  Ones that log you out if you&rsquo;re idle for long enough?  <a href="http://www.laffeycomputer.com/spinner.html">Spinner</a> is a program that runs in the background and periodically sends characters to keep your session from going idle.  Cool.</p>

    <p>I was browsing around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">my favorite interwebsite</a> and I noticed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_with_titles_that_don't_appear_in_the_lyrics">this page</a> .  Ok, so maybe not everything on Wikipedia is useful&hellip;</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 19, 2006</div>
    <p>So, I knew it was going to be cold on Thursday when the NPR 5 minute news brief, which sticks to big stories like terrorists taking control of Israel or massive protests by fundamentalists, had a guy from the National Weather Service on saying, &ldquo;This is going to be the first arctic air burst we&rsquo;ve had all year; it&rsquo;s going to be quite cold.&rdquo;
