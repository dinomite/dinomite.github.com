    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 19, 2008</div>
    <p><a href="http://www.2600.com/oth/">The Off The Hook site</a> takes a while to post synopsis of the episodes and once they are posted, the overviews aren&rsquo;t very detailed.  I&rsquo;m going to start taking some notes as I listen to the show and putting them here, for the good of all internet denizens who may find this via Google.</p>

<p>Emmanuel noted that the theme was missing, so he was playing it from a recording of the show that he downloaded last week.  Mitch Altman, who was returning from the <a href="http://www.ccc.de">Chaos Communication Congress</a> and is the creator of the <a href="http://www.tvbgone.com">TV-B-Gone</a>, was on again; he and Emmanuel discussed <a href="http://gizmodo.com/343348/confessions-the-meanest-thing-gizmodo-did-at-ces">Gizmodo&rsquo;s use of the device at CES</a>.</p>

<p>Emmanuel noted a new program in California that will allow utilities to control home thermostats via radio signals as a method for reducing peak energy usage so as to mitigate rolling blackouts.  Not Kevin wonders how long it will take until someone finds a way to control the temperature of their neighbor&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>A kid in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Lodz, Poland</a> created a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/11/tram_hack/">remote control to control the trams</a> in the town.  Not Kevin and Mitch discuss whether the remote that the kid created was really like a TV remote employing infrared as was reported.  Emmanuel compares it to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Infrared_Transmitter">chrome box</a> and Bernie points out that infrared isn&rsquo;t a very robust method, susceptible to weather conditions that could hamper its operation.</p>

<p>Wisconsin contracted out a mailing to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Data_Systems">EDS</a> who printed <a href="http://consumerist.com/345585/social-security-numbers-visible-on-envelopes-mailed-by-wisconsin-again">social security numbers on the outside of envelopes</a>.  Bernie notes that the government officials always preach their concern for citizen&rsquo;s privacy and guesses correctly that all those affected will receive a free year of credit monitoring, only to be automatically enrolled in such a service for a significant charge at the end of said year.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration">TSA</a> took down a horribly insecure website intended to allow people to remove themselves from the no-fly list.  The contract for the site was awarded to <a href="http://desyne.com">Desyne Web Services</a> by a TSA employee who previously worked for the firm.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing">Boeing</a>&rsquo;s new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787">787</a> aircraft, which will have internet access available, is going to be thoroughly check to ensure that the internet link is in no way connected to the plane&rsquo;s avionics.  Bernie mentions Boeing&rsquo;s ill-fated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connexion_by_Boeing">Connexion</a> service.</p>

<p>Bernie talks about a new hacker space, <a href="http://www.thehacktory.org">The Hacktory</a>, which he is helping to put together as an extension of the <a href="http://makephilly.org">Philadelphia Make group</a>.  Mitch talks about visiting <a href="http://bootlab.org">Bootlab</a> in Berlin, <a href="http://www.tmplabs.com">TMP LABS</a> in Paris and <a href="http://c-base.org">c-base</a> as well as <a href="http://dc401.org">DC401</a> in Providence and <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net">NoiseBridge</a>.  Emmanuel brings up past hacker spaces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0pht">L0pht</a> and New Hack City that eventually failed and questions whether these new ones will last.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/01/15/code-golf-grid-computing/">Code Golf: Grid Computing</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan 15, 2008</div>
    <p><a href="http://codegolf.com/grid-computing">A new puzzle</a> went up on <a href="http://codegolf.com">Code Golf</a> a few weeks ago and I finally got some time to sit down and hack on it, so here&rsquo;s another annotated instalment of my pruning process.  I haven&rsquo;t gotten anywhere near the smallest solutions which are half of my 109 characters.  See the action below, but don&rsquo;t look if you don&rsquo;t want hints! </p>

<p>Initially, a straightforward <code>for</code> loop that reads from standard input or a passed file; huzzah for Perl&rsquo;s built-in flexibility.  Within this loop, a counter, <code>$n</code>, is incremented to fill an array, <code>@c</code>, with the sum of each column; the sum of the row is stored in <code>$r</code>.  At the end of each iteration of the loop, the greatest row sum, <code>$a</code>, is set to the just-completed row if said row is greater than what has been seen previously or the answer is <code>undef</code>, as it is the first time through.  The lower loop puts the greatest column sum into <code>$b</code>.</p>

<p>My first pass through is 190 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for (&lt;&gt;) {
    $n = $r = 0;
    for (split &#39; &#39;, $<em>) {
        @c[$n] += $</em>;
        $r += $_;
        $n++;
    }</p>
<div class="highlight plaintext"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>$a = $r if ($r &gt; $a);
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>}</p>

<p>for (@c) {
    $b = $_ if ($_ &gt; $b);
}</p>

<p>($b &gt; $a) ? print $b.$/ : print $a.$/;
</pre></p>

<p>Note that Perl is flexible; by using <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, input can be passed as a file on the command line or via stdin.  With some quick re-ordering of the top loop and turning the lower loop into a <code>map</code>, 20 characters are saved.  170 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for (&lt;&gt;) {
    $n = $r = 0;
    @c[$n++] += $<em>, $r += $</em> for (split &#39; &#39;, $_);</p>
<div class="highlight plaintext"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>$a = $r if ($r &gt; $a);
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>}</p>

<p>map {$b = $_ if ($_ &gt; $b)} @c;</p>

<p>($b &gt; $a) ? print $b.$/ : print $a.$/;
</pre></p>

<p>Much of the whitespace can be removed (though I&rsquo;ll leave the newlines for now).  Down to 138 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for(&lt;&gt;){
    $n=$r=0;
    @c[$n++]+=$<em>, $r+=$</em> for split&#39; &#39;,$_;
    $a=$r if $r&gt;$a;
}</p>

<p>map{$b=$_ if $_&gt;$b} @c;</p>

<p>$b&gt;$a ? print $b.$/ : print $a.$/;
</pre></p>

<p>The <code>print</code> can be simplified, dropping 6 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for(&lt;&gt;){
    $n=$r=0;
    @c[$n++]+=$<em>, $r+=$</em> for split&#39; &#39;,$_;
    $a=$r if $r&gt;$a;
}</p>

<p>map{$b=$_ if $_&gt;$b} @c;</p>

<p>print $b&gt;$a ? $b.$/ : $a.$/;
</pre></p>

<p>At which point I&rsquo;m stuck.  After beating out the last bits of whitespace, that is 109 characters.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jan  3, 2008</div>
    <p>While writing some Python code today I came to a point where a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement">switch</a> might have been appropriate.  Knowing that switch statements, like any control structure, differ amongst languages I ran a quick search and came up with this  <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/">Python Enhancement Proposal</a>.  The first paragraph of that page is a rejection notice which states, quite simply, &ldquo;A quick poll during my keynote presentation at PyCon 2007 shows this proposal has no popular support. I therefore reject it.&rdquo;  Wow, that&rsquo;s quite a unilateral decision; I looked at the author, &ldquo;&lsquo;guido at python.org&rdquo;&rsquo; and thought, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s certainly his prerogative,&rdquo; for, if you recall analogies from the SAT, Guido van Rossum : Python :: Linus Torvalds : the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>As I pondered Python&rsquo;s lack of this control statement I began to think, well, this probably is the best way for something like Python to be run.  Python is a language that has many passionate follows, many of whom would jump at the chance to make their mark by extending the language.  If the development model allowed anyone to add to it without due process, the language would quickly become cluttered and useless.  No project would ever be run this way, but there are many that employ a loose committee to make such decisions.  Even in that case, however, the committee would certainly waste much time hemming and hawing over the best way to implement the switch and other minutia.  Having a single person in charge makes such project control simple.  Guido, who we can assume is an experience programmer with a good handle on the craft, hence the fact that he created Python and is affectionately known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life">Benevolent Dictator for Life</a>.  He simply explored the possible options, asked around to see whether this really was a lacking feature of Python and then decided.  End of story.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/01/02/first-impressions-from-campaign-websites/">First Impressions from Campaign Websites</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan  2, 2008</div>
    <p>Ron Paul is an internet celebrity in the realm of campaign fund raising and for good reason: his campaign has garnered $19.5 million in donations in the fourth quarter, $6 million of that on the December 16th anniversary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party">Boston Tea Party</a>.  The news media never fails to mention his internet popularity and the fact that the majority of his donations stem from the tubes that run the new world.  When I went to check out Ron Paul&rsquo;s website and that of some other candidates, I was intrigued.  Users who go to the <a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com">Super Libertarian&rsquo;s internet presence</a> are presented with a clean and informative site:</p>

<p><a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ron_paul1.png' title='Ron Paul campaign web page'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ron_paul1.png' alt='Ron Paul campaign web page' height='350' width='522' /></a></p>

<p>Top and center is useful information, in this case the time until the upcoming caucus in Iowa and primaries in New Hampshire.  The site includes information about his fund raising effort, links to donate and a form for getting campaign update emails below the fold.  Visiting other campaign sites is a different story:</p>

<p><a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/clinton.png' title='Hillary Clinton campaign web page'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/clinton.png' alt='Hillary Clinton campaign web page' height='328' width='402'/></a></p>

<p><a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/obama.png' title='Barack Obama campaign web page'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/obama.png' alt='Barack Obama campaign web page' height='334' width='446'/></a></p>

<p>When you visit the websites for <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com">HIllary Clinton</a> or <a href="http://www.barackobama.com">Barack Obama</a> you are asked for contact information before seeing anything substantive.  You have to fill out the form or click through to get to the candidate&rsquo;s website.  Thankfully, their websites send cookies; subsequent visits forgo the information garnering forms whether or not you put in anything.  But why put up this stumbling block?  Ron Paul&rsquo;s site is much more elegant; the form for signing up to get campaign information is still easy to get to, but it&rsquo;s not intrusive. </p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2008/01/01/perl-5-dot-10-dot-0/">Perl 5.10.0</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jan  1, 2008</div>
    <p>Sure, it&rsquo;s already slathered across every news site known to man but just like everyone else I have different reasons for being excited about Perl 5.10.0.</p>

<p>Like many others, I often choose Perl for its seamless regex support so the faster regex engine in this new release is definitely welcome.  This version also fixes an erroneous piece of missing syntax for subscript slices. I was always confused why the interpreter forced me to use <code>-&gt;</code> instead of the non-arrowed form.  The big one, not because it was hugely lacking but simply a seemingly odd oversight, is the switch statement, which is called <code>given/when</code> in Perl:</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
given ($foo) {
    when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; }
    when (/^def/) { $def = 1; }
    when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; }
    default { $nothing = 1; }
}
</pre>

<p>Sure, switch statements don&rsquo;t really do anything special, but they are often quite a bit cleaner than if/elif chains and the fact that Perl&rsquo;s implementation can handle regex is awesome.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/12/19/web-browsing-with-python/">Web Browsing With Python</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Dec 19, 2007</div>
    <p>Python provides a stateful web browsing module called <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/"><code>mechanize</code></a>, named after Perl&rsquo;s mature and featureful <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/PETDANCE/WWW-Mechanize-1.34/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm"><code>WWW::Mechanize</code></a>.  Though it isn&rsquo;t as powerful as the Perl version, <code>mechanize</code> provides an easy-to-use framework for browsing web pages including interacting with forms and accessing SSL content.  The documentation for <code>mechanize</code> on the web is sparse, but viewing the source file (<code>/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/mechanize/_mechanize.py</code> on my Ubuntu machine) provides some needed insight.  Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the operation of <code>mechanize</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">
#!/usr/bin/python
import re
from mechanize import Browser
br = Browser()

# Ignore robots.txt
br.set_handle_robots( False )
# Google demands a user-agent that isn't a robot
br.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Firefox')]

# Retrieve the Google home page, saving the response
br.open( "http://google.com" )

# Select the search box and search for 'foo'
br.select_form( 'f' )
br.form[ 'q' ] = 'foo'

# Get the search results
br.submit()

# Find the link to foofighters.com; why did we run a search?
resp = None
for link in br.links():
    siteMatch = re.compile( 'www.foofighters.com' ).search( link.url )
    if siteMatch:
        resp = br.follow_link( link )
        break

# Print the site
content = resp.get_data()
print content
</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty straightforward and simple usage.  The <code>get_data()</code> method gives you the HTML content of the pages, which I often find suitable to run a <code>.split(&#39;\n&#39;)</code> and then do some regex on line by line.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/12/11/random-futurama/">Random Futurama</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Dec 11, 2007</div>
    <p>I like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a>.  All of it.  Though I occasionally have a hankering for a specific episode, I often just want /any/ episode, so I wrote a quick Perl script to play one at random.  I have a directory filled with all of Futurama, so this is an easy proposition:</p>

<pre class="brush: perl;">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @files = split /\n/, `ls *avi`;

my $num = rand(scalar(@files));

system "mplayer "$files[$num]"";
</pre>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/12/07/custom-weather-radar-images/">Custom Weather Radar Images</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Dec  7, 2007</div>
    <p><a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/base_reflectivity.jpg' title='NWS base reflectivity for LWX' class='right'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/base_reflectivity.jpg' alt='NWS base reflectivity for LWX' /></a>
If you know the slightest bit about weather and the geography of the area which you are observing, you can, in the short term, forecast more accurately than what a weather website provides.  I often want to be able to bring a radar image up quickly and clicking around websites takes time.  Sure I could bookmark the weather page directly, but this was an interesting exercise and will prove useful when I get an iPhone.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://nws.noaa.gov">National Weather Service</a> doesn&rsquo;t have a simple image of the weather on their <a href="http://radar.weather.gov/radar.php?rid=lwx&amp;product=N0R&amp;overlay=11101111&amp;loop=no">radar page</a>, rather, it is an image that is dynamically generated from a set of standard overlays using Javascript.  This allows them to more efficiently distribute radar images, since the terrain and maps that are the background never change.  The organization they use is <a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/doppler/ridge_download.htm">well documented</a>, making it easy to find the overlays for you local radar.  In my case, I wanted the topographical map, counties and highways in the image.    I found the URL for each of these components using the aforementioned documentation and grabbed the appropriate images with <code>wget</code>.
<pre>
wget http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Legend/N0R/LWX<em>N0R</em>Legend<em>0.gif\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Overlays/County/Short/LWX</em>County<em>Short.gif\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Overlays/Highways/Short/LWX</em>Highways<em>Short.gif\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Overlays/Topo/Short/LWX</em>Topo<em>Short.jpg\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/RadarImg/N0R/LWX</em>N0R_0.gif
</pre></p>

<p>The only layer that will change will be the last one, the actual radar data, so in my script that is the only one that will be <code>wget</code>d on subsequent runs.  To build the image, I used the <code>composite</code> program that is part of the ImageMagick package:
<pre>
composite -compose atop LWX<em>N0R</em>0.gif LWX<em>Topo</em>Short.jpg base<em>reflectivity.jpg
composite -compose atop LWX</em>Highways<em>Short.gif base</em>reflectivity.jpg base<em>reflectivity.jpg
composite -compose atop LWX</em>County<em>Short.gif base</em>reflectivity.jpg base<em>reflectivity.jpg
composite -compose atop LWX</em>N0R<em>Legend</em>0.gif base<em>reflectivity.jpg base</em>reflectivity.jpg
</pre></p>

<p>I want the counties, highways and legend to show up on top of the weather data which itself is pasted atop the topographical map.  To achieve this, I first toss the radar data onto the topographical image creating a new image, <code>base_reflectivity.jpg</code>.  Then, I add each of the other layers to the <code>base_reflectivity.jpg</code> image in sequence.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Dec  4, 2007</div>
    <p>If you have forgotten, were never given or otherwise don&rsquo;t have the password to an Oracle database, never fear, there is a method to accessing the database.  From the local machine you must be a user in the group &ldquo;ora_dba&rdquo;.  Run &ldquo;sqlplus&rdquo; (the command line version) with the option &ldquo;/nolog&rdquo;, which tells SQL*Plus not to login.  At the &ldquo;SQL&gt;&rdquo; prompt, type &ldquo;connect / as sysdba&rdquo; which ought to log you in.  At that point, you can change the password for any account (<code>sys</code> would be a good one to change, since apparently you don&rsquo;t know it) using the command <code>alter user &lt;username&gt; identified by &quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot;;</code>.  Make sure to <code>commit;</code> after doing that.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Dec  2, 2007</div>
    <p>I woke up to find the entitled error in the <code>rsnapshot</code> logs on one of my machines, which occurred as it was trying to remotely backup, via SSH, another.  A quick search and reading through a number of threads revealed <a href="http://monkey.org/openbsd/archive/misc/0207/msg02592.html">this message</a> stating that this problem was encountered with a Linksys router involved.  Lo and behold, my home network was just switched to a Linksys BEFSR41 when the problem began.</p>

<p>I think the router may also be the culprit for the occasional &ldquo;error establishing encrypted connection code -12192&rdquo; that Firefox has been giving me since the switch.</p>
