    <p>Smoking food is great; the only downside is that if you want it ready for an afternoon barbecue, you have to get up early to put the meat to the heat.  Alton Brown&rsquo;s recipe for <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_23019,00.html">pulled pork</a> is what I use; it simply consists of brining a pork shoulder overnight and then smoking with a simple rub.  If you&rsquo;ve got the smoker running, you might as well toss on <a href="http://www.aolfoodblog.com/2007/05/30/smokin-cherry/">other</a> <a href="http://www.recipegoldmine.com/smoke/smoke22.html">stuff</a> as well.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Jun  1, 2007</div>
    <p>I found a new, easy process for installing VMware on Ubuntu, having updated the kernel on my Feisty machine since the last time I used the virtual machine.  Whenever the kernel changes, VMware needs to rebuild it&rsquo;s kernel module to suit, via the script <code>vmware-config.pl</code>.  This involves a few steps such that VMware can correctly build it&rsquo;s module against the kernel you&rsquo;re running.  First, you need to grab the headers for your running kernel and set them up to support building:</p>

<pre>
~$ sudo -i
~# aptitude install linux-headers-`uname -r`
~# cd /usr/src/
/usr/src# ln -s linux-headers-2.6.20-16-`uname -r` linux
/usr/src# cd linux
/usr/src/linux# cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
/usr/src/linux# make oldconfig && make prepare0 && make scripts
</pre>

<p>The above installs the kernel headers for your current kernel (<code>uname -r&#39; gives the running kernel&#39;s version), gets the</code>.config<code>for said kernel and preps the headers per the</code>.config`.  Now, on to the VMware part of things.</p>

<p>Installing VMware is really easy, thanks to <a href="http://ftp.cvut.cz/vmware/vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz">this patch</a>.  You simply need to get the patch, untar and run it; the script included invokes the VMware configurator automatically.</p>

<pre>
/usr/src# wget http://ftp.cvut.cz/vmware/vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz
/usr/src# tar zxf vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz
/usr/src# cd vmware-any-any-update109
/usr/src/vmware-any-any-update109# ./runme.pl
</pre>

<p>Follow the directions provided by the VMware configuration script (the defaults are safe, but read the information) and you&rsquo;re done.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">May 22, 2007</div>
    <p>Amongst all of the recent news about climate change, I started hearing about large corporations, even oil and car companies, who were backing legislation such as carbon caps.  The most notable of these groups is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Climate_Action_Partnership">US Climate Action Partnership</a> which includes companies like BP America and PG&amp;E that are throughly tied to fossil fuels.  Why are these companies supportive of legislation that will create wholesale changes in the manner in which their industries operate?</p>

<p>First and foremost, these companies aren&rsquo;t stupid and realize that, given the current political climate where human-induced global warming has become accepted as truth, their best move is to mitigate the effects of legislation that changes the way their businesses operate.  The best way to run any business is to simply keep on trucking; if you can sell the same product or service without having to change what you deliver or the manner in which you create it, your operating costs will be very low.  A cap-and-trade system would certainly change the way any carbon-producing industry must operate, but it probably wouldn&rsquo;t require as much change in facilities and production methods as more specifically defined legislation.  Cap-and-trade simply states, &ldquo;Either release less carbon or buy the right to pollute more from someone else.&rdquo;  This gives companies a lot of options.</p>

<p>The more sinister reason that carbon producers support cap-and-trade legislation is that they know the world is changing.  Alternative fuels are gaining momentum as gas prices soar and hatred of pollution and high prices adds to the animosity towards carbon-based fuels.  Tempering this hatred with pseudo-green initiatives like supporting carbon-control legislation may help fossil-fuel dependent companies stand up to other energy sources.  This also has the side effect of possibly convincing some rainy-day environmentalists that oil companies aren&rsquo;t so bad after all.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">May 17, 2007</div>
    <p><a href="http://www.izpack.org">IzPack</a> is a great installer written in Java and configured with XML files, though the documentation can be a little bit lacking.  This OK because the variables are all named well so one can easily look to an existing installer (such as that for IzPack itself or 7-zip) and copy needed bits of code.  One thing that I found elusive was how to set the default install directory to something other than &ldquo;C:\Program Files&amp;lt;product name&gt;&rdquo;.  The &lt;info&gt; element provides an &lt;appsubpath&gt; element that allows you to specify something other than &lt;product name&gt;, but you&rsquo;re still limited to something within the default Windows installation directory.  Alas, mailing lists to the rescue!  <a href="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/izpack-users/2006-November/002928.html">This post</a> describes declaring a resource in the install.xml and after a bit of fiddling I came up with the following.</p>

<p>First, create a file TargetDir.txt with nothing more than the path you want to install at, for me that file simply contained &ldquo;C:\foo&rdquo;.  Next, point to the resource in the install.xml:</p>

<p><code><pre>
&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;!-- Set the default installation directory shown in the TargetPanel --&gt;
    &lt;res id=&quot;TargetPanel.dir&quot; src=&quot;TargetDir.txt&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</pre></code></p>

<p>Rebuild the installer and you&rsquo;re set.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/05/11/finding-perl-module-dependencies/">Finding Perl Module Dependencies</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">May 11, 2007</div>
    <p>So you&rsquo;ve written a Perl program and want to give it to someone else.  The only problem is, like any good Perl program, you&rsquo;ve made good use of modules, some of which may be non-standard.  The person in question may not be able to install modules on the machine they&rsquo;re going to be running your script on, or maybe you just don&rsquo;t want to hassle them with that.  The easy way is to give them the modules in the proper directory structure right alongside your program; they simply toss the group of modules in the same directory as the script and when it&rsquo;s run the Perl interpreter searches . (the current directory) for the modules, finds them and goes about its merry way.</p>

<p>The only hiccup, some of the modules you&rsquo;ve used depend on other modules&hellip;which may have further dependencies.  Rather than suffer through dependency reminiscent of Red Hat (even the newest version&hellip;), you can use the Devel::Modlist module which will tell you which modules are required to run the program.  Invoked with the &lsquo;nocore&rsquo; option, Devel::Modlist will ignore standard modules, which ought to be installed with any Perl distribution.  Here is an example from a program I wrote; the only module I invoke directly is XML::SAX.</p>

<pre><code>
~/code$ perl -d -MDevel::Modlist=nocore merge.pl foo.xml bar.xml

    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 26, 2007</div>
    <p><a href="http://dinomite.net/archives/tar-over-ssh">In our last episode</a> we used tar to move a file structure across the network.  This time, to create a tarball directly onto another machine the following command can be used:</p>

<p><code>
tar czf - foo/ | ssh user@host &quot;cat &gt; /path/to/foo.tgz&quot;
</code></p>

<p>This is useful if the machine you&rsquo;re taring from doesn&rsquo;t have enough disk space to hold the tarball.  Furthermore, it&rsquo;s probably faster because the tarball is only being written once, directly to its final location.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 25, 2007</div>
    <p>Like many &lsquo;enterprise solutions,&rsquo; Oracle is a despicable piece of software that has a tendency to eat copious amounts of memory and processor time.  Alas, ranting on my hatred of enterprise hardware and software is not the subject of this post.  A big part of enterprise applications is that they are usually accompanied by abundant amounts of documentation, sadly, much of it useless.  The tomes (physical or electronic) included often overlook the simplest of functions delving straight into the guts of the system and focusing on minutiae.  Despite the fact that everyone needs to perform these elementary tasks that are buried deep within the documentation, it&rsquo;s often difficult to find a solution by searching the internet.  My search for how to use <code>sqlplus</code> to connect to a remote database (I had previously only used it locally, on the server running Oracle) turned up a few results and led me to this solution:</p>

<p><code>
~$ sqlplus uname/pass@[//hostname[:port]/]sid
</code></p>

<p>Really, it&rsquo;s quite straightforward.</p>

    <p>I installed Koni Adjustable Sport shocks on my <a href="http://gallery.dinomite.net/v/Cars/BMW_M3/">M3</a> a few months ago and before even driving the car I turned them to full stiff, like ya do.  Who want&rsquo;s anything but the most hardcore?  I finally got around to turning them down this past week (it&rsquo;s not like I go to the track all that often) and what a difference that makes!  Koni Yellows on full-soft are just like stock shocks and with a few turns under the hood, they become a good bit more go-kart like.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/04/15/introduction-to-genres-of-electronic-music-through-remixes/">Introduction to Genres of Electronic Music through Remixes</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 15, 2007</div>
    <p>Undoubtedly, the most comprehensive map to electronic music is <a href="http://www.di.fm/edmguide/edmguide.html">Ishkur&rsquo;s Guide</a> which covers every genre, even reaching out to Rap, much of which contains electronic elements.  Ishkur&rsquo;s Guide is certainly worth perusing if you&rsquo;re interested in electronic music, but is a bit cumbersome for someone simply looking for an overview.  The best way to get a quick understanding of the different genres within electronic music is to hear the same song presented through different interpretations.  Madonna&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Prayer_%28song%29"><em>Like a Prayer</em></a> fits this bill nicely, as it has been remixed by numerous artists in a myriad of styles.</p>

<p><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/madonna-like-a-prayer-original.mp3">The original</a> version of the song is a pop-styled electronic-backed vocal ensemble with a number of distinct elements.  Taking note of the song&rsquo;s components is important to understanding which parts the remixes keep, which they alter and what from the song is tossed out completely.  The archetype begins with an odd riff from a guitar that isn&rsquo;t heard anywhere else in the song, nor in any remixes; such introductions are often thrown to the wayside when songs are remixed.  From there, the song progresses with an ethereal chorus backing Madonna&rsquo;s airy and LOVING vocals which sets the mood.  From there, the an 80&rsquo;s electric bass and drum set are added, which come and go throughout the balance of the tune.  As you will hear in the remixes all of the elements of the song will be subject to change.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-house-mix.mp3">Mad'House'smix</a></li>
</ul>

<p>First is a version by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad'House">Mad&#39;House</a>, a short-lived ensemble which <em>only</em> made remixes of Madonna songs.  I would describe this mix as having a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">house</a> feel, which is certainly in keeping the the group&rsquo;s intentions.  It adds a harder base beat, electronic bass kicks and replaces Madonna&rsquo;s vocals with those of Buse ÃœnlÃ¼, the group&rsquo;s vocalist.  This track keeps true to the feeling of the original, while forgoing the instrumentation in pop princess&rsquo; version entirely.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-club-mix.mp3">DJ M bbe&rsquo;s club mix</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Break out your subwoofer, because the club mix is here.  Club music is, hence the name, intended for dance clubs, which accounts for the overpowering bass kick.  Beyond Mad&#39;House&rsquo;s mix, this track brings the aforementioned bass beat, more heavily altered vocals and transforms the choir to make them sound much more anthem-esque.  Club mixes are all about big sounds in a vain attempt to keep from being drowned out in the hustle of late-night dancing and in doing so, share the self righteousness that Anthem Trance (see Ishkur&rsquo;s guide) is known for; all tension and power without any release.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-hi-nrg-mix.mp3">Anabolic Frolic&rsquo;s HI-NRG mix</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-NRG">HI-NRG</a> is the music of raver kiddies.  If you&rsquo;ve ever seen the movie <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%281999_film%29">Go</a></em>, you know what raves are about.  Lots of drugs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenedioxymethamphetamine">ecstacy</a> in particular, sex and dancing&hellip;all..night&hellip;long.  The dancing, not the sex.  Really.  Only when rolling would one feel the need to dance to such fast-paced music for 10 hours straight.  150 beats per minute is the minimum here, folks.  A continuous rising and falling ethereal piano is a staple of HI-NRG, as are the high-pitched vocals replacing the calmer and more subdued singing of Madonna.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Frolic">Anabolic Frolic</a>&rsquo;s Happy2bHardcore series of mix albums is characteristic of the genre.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-gabber-mix.mp3">Gabber mix</a></li>
</ul>

<p>150 beats per minute, no less.  Deafening bass beats, chipmunk vocals and hard charging melodies.  These are the tenets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabber">gabber</a>.  The original song?  Yeah, it&rsquo;s in there somewhere, represented in the tings, thumps and industrial sounds pervasive within the gabber genre.  When someone who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy electronic music (or, more often, thinks they won&rsquo;t like it) describes &ldquo;techno,&rdquo; this is what a sketch artist would build from their description.  In reality, however, gabber is on the fringe of the electronic genre, the bastard child of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music">industrial</a> and HI-NRG.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-darkcore-mix.mp3">Mr. Bungle&rsquo;s darkcore mix</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You probably wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed that someone could make <em>Like a Prayer</em> sound evil and depressing, but here it is.  Replace the vocals with those of an angsty adolescent, simplify the beats down to electronic drum hits, replace the melody with a spartan version from a machine and you&rsquo;ve got yourself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkcore">darkcore</a>. </p>

    <p>Windows Server 2003 (or maybe it&rsquo;s just Internet Explorer 7) has a number of wonderful features that will make every day a cheery adventure.  Among them are draconian security policies that, beyond making little sense, are controlled from places they don&rsquo;t belong.  Apparently a mapped network share is considered a web page.  Who would have guessed that?  Well, if you get the error in the title when trying to run or even right-click something from a share on the network, it can be fixed from Internet Options.  From IE7, press &lsquo;alt&rsquo; to show the menu, go to Tools&gt;Internet Options.  In the Internet Options window, go to the security tab, select the &#39;Internet&rsquo; zone and click &#39;Custom&rsquo; near the bottom right.  In the resulting window under &#39;Miscellaneous&rsquo;, set things that say &#39;disable&rsquo; to &#39;prompt&rsquo; or &#39;enable&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;m not sure which one controls the above mentioned behavior, but it ought to be fairly obvious which are involved; just allow them. </p>
