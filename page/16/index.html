    <div class="article-title-date">Aug 15, 2007</div>
    <p>Perl is a great language for web programming and one of the features that makes it well suited is <em>Taint Mode</em>.  Perl&rsquo;s Taint Mode, quite simply, restricts what the programmer can do with variables that are acquired from user input.  If a programs relies on the user to specify something, it&rsquo;s a bad assumption to treat those values as safe for use in operations that may affect the outside world, such as opening files and using tainted values in <code>system()</code> calls.  Perl wont restrict you from using tainted values in innocuous things such as print statements but it does pass taintedness on to other variables that a tainted value touches.  Furthermore, modules such as DBI support recognizing taintedness of variable for safety.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Aug 11, 2007</div>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not often that I praise any of the American auto manufacturers, least of all Chevrolet.  This isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m a European car fanboy or otherwise prejudiced against American cars but simply because they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Five_Hundred">churn</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Impala">out</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Aztek">so</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Neon">much</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile">crap</a>.  The chronic problem for manufacturers is that of  <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000321.html">least-common-deonminator, good-enough, penny-pinching engineering</a>.</p>

<p>Though I&rsquo;m a little bit behind the ball, Chevy <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/06/chevy-introduces-hhr-panel/">announced</a> that they would be making a panel-van version of their retro-styled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_HHR">HHR</a> mini-SUV; this is the first good idea to come out of the C-shop in a long time.  Small businesses have needs to transfer things just like larger ones.  Plumbers and contractors have a reason to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Econoline">full-size van</a>, since they want to carry around a lot of tools and spare parts.  If you&rsquo;re not into construction, however, that&rsquo;s a bit much.  Beyond being more vehicle than you want to buy and getting terrible gas mileage, it&rsquo;s difficult to park and maneuver.  Sure, you can get a minivan for your small business but that leaves you little area to put logos and it&rsquo;s also too low, down below the windows.  Furthermore, a minivan is still often more space than is necessary.  So you could look at small hatchbacks such as the <a href="#">Mazda 3</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord">Honda Accord</a> which are nice, but a little bit too small and still offer little space for advertising on the outside.</p>

<p>The HHR is just the right size; it&rsquo;s Goldilocks&rsquo; preferred size, providing enough room to care somewhat bulky items (flowers, small catering gear, computers), a few cubbys for tools and some good space for plastering a logo on the outside.  I really think this is perfect for small business like florists, computer support and even someone like Charm City Cakes, who are often on Food Network transporting a wedding cake in a huge Econoline van.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/08/09/interfacial-fracture-of-oreo-cookie-filling/">Interfacial Fracture of Oreo Cookie Filling</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Aug  9, 2007</div>
    <p>While reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipeidia</a> page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive">adhesive</a> I came across this nugget of wisdom on food decomposition:</p>

<blockquote>Another example is when someone tries to pull apart Oreo cookies and all the filling remains on one side. The goal in this case is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, when you&rsquo;re trying to break apart an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo">Oreo</a> and get all the filling to stay on one side, say, to make a quad-stuf (yep, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo#Varieties">only one &lsquo;f&rsquo;</a>) Oreo, you are hoping for an adhesive or interfacial failure, that is, a failure of the adhesive (white, corn-syrupy goodness) where it meets the adherent (black cookie piece).</p>

<p>Also, for another barely-related angle is <a href="http://massmma.net/readMore.php?id=245">this page</a> from a UFC forum discussing the caloric content of foods someone mentions their method of making Oreos less bad for you:</p>

<blockquote>i just want everyone to know this lil diet trick i use to cut calories out of my double stuff oreos, if you take 2 of them apart and make 1 quad stuff oreo you eliminate 2 of the chocholat cookies there for cutting out calories while you enjoy a nice diet quad stuff oreo</blockquote>

<p>Though I&rsquo;d say the perfect ratio of filling to cookie is somewhere between 2 and 3 to one, I often make quad-stuf monsters.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Aug  8, 2007</div>
    <p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s default paper size is the very international <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_paper_size">A4</a>.   Unfortunately, here in the United States the standard size of paper is Letter (8&#189; inches by 11 inches).  When trying to print, Ubuntu will tell printers to use A4 paper unless you select &lsquo;Letter&rsquo; in the print dialog each time.  To change this default, simply run the following command which will set the value in <code>/etc/papersize</code>:</p>

<p><code>
sudo dpkg-reconfigure libpaper1
</code></p>

    <p><a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/">The Freakonomics Blog</a> mentioned <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/newspaper/premium/printedition/Sunday/chi-cell_bdaug05,0,3857748.story?coll=chi-newslocalchicago-hed">a story</a> about mobile phone providers knowing that something was happening near the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis due to hugely increased call volumes.  Later in the article there is also a mention of T-Mobile tracking the change in commuting patterns by the movement of cell phones.</p>

<p>Cell phone activity, just like any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack">side-channel attack</a>, can be exploited to learn a lot about a population.  There are certainly legal and privacy implications to such data being made public, but it would be amazing to look at from a research point of view.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Aug  2, 2007</div>
    <p>Almost every time I get into my Mom&rsquo;s car, I find that the radio is coming from the front-right speaker only.  You see, she has an Acura TL which has a stereo that features two main knobs.  Pushing the left knob turns it on or off and turning it adjusts the volume.  The right knob is used for tuning the radio but can also adjust output characteristics (bass, treble, fade and balance) which are cycled through by pushing the knob.  It seems that when attempting to tune the radio she may accidentally push in the knob causing any further turning of said knob to adjust the bass and treble to full and shift the sound all the way to the right side, front most speaker.  This isn&rsquo;t her fault; she&rsquo;s driving and ought to be able to easily fumble with the radio to make adjustments without looking down.  This is a case of bad user interface design.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/07/31/day-2-austria/">Day 2: Austria</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jul 31, 2007</div>
    <p>On our second day in Europe, the first destination was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein">Neuschwanstein</a>, the castle which served as the inspiration for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_Castle">Sleeping Beauty Castle</a> in Disneyland.  First, though, we had to get some breakfast.  Upon greeting the inkeeper, we were told of the breakfast options, &ldquo;Hungry?  Ja, you will have muesli.&rdquo;  In addition to muesli atop some very good yogurt there was a spread of meats and cheeses that would become standard over the next few days.</p>

<p>After breakfast and a short walk around the monastery, the first of many churches, we hopped into the 5 and headed toward Austria which we would skip through on our way to the castle.  After a fairly uneventful drive along some motoroways and a stop in at a tourist info center, we came upon the road that, from looking at the map, seemed to be the best route to Neuschwanstein.  Though it meandered through a valley next to a beautiful blue-green <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plansee">Plansee</a>, this road turned out to be a somewhat undesirable avenue to the schlo&#x00DF;.  Most Americans are aware that smaller cars rule in Europe and being there only reinforces this fact.  A 5 series is a sizable vehicle, but certainly not &ldquo;large&rdquo; by US standards; in Europe, however, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine having to drive anything larger.  The road that we had chosen was two car widths wide, but only barely.  With my right wheels centimeters from the edge of the road (and wooden posts only a decimeter or so from said edge), the wing mirrors of cars passing in the other direction were no more than a hand-width from my own.  In a brand-new car, this is not a relaxing time.  In time, though, I became accustomed to this because of the much greater skill of European drivers.  Generally, you don&rsquo;t have to drive as though everyone around you is incompetent, unlike here in America.</p>

<p>We got to the castle and had to take a vigorous hike up a few kilometers of mountain to reach the castle.  Such a tourist attraction wouldn&rsquo;t survive in the US; Americans won&rsquo;t walk up a hill, they would demand motorized transport.  It was a good walk and lead to some wonderful views from the castle and impressive works within.</p>

<p>After leaving Neuschwanstein, we had to make our way to France for the Formula 1 race the next day.  We hopped in the car and headed West, stopping at a supermarket in Austria to pick up some bottled water.  I mention the water because after studying the numerous varieties we bought two six packs, one marked &ldquo;Naturel&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;Stille.&rdquo;  Turns out the latter has bubbles and the former doesn&rsquo;t, which was opposite our expectations.</p>

<p>When we arrive at our bed and breakfast in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puligny-Montrachet">Puligny-Montrachet</a> the  innkeeper informed us that the nice restaurant would be full since we were there so late, but if we didn&rsquo;t mind something &ldquo;not so fancy,&rdquo; there was a place just a kilometer walk down the road.   Upon arriving at the restaurant we found that it was not far from fancy at all and served a wonderful meal including a final cheese course.  Very French and very, very good.</p>

    <p>Vim can show you non-printing characters simply by issuing the command <code>:set invlist</code> which works just like the old <strong>reveal codes</strong>  in WordPerfect or Word&rsquo;s <strong>show &#xB6;</strong>.</p>
