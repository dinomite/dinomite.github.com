    <div class="article-title-date">Aug  8, 2007</div>
    <p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s default paper size is the very international <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_paper_size">A4</a>.   Unfortunately, here in the United States the standard size of paper is Letter (8&#189; inches by 11 inches).  When trying to print, Ubuntu will tell printers to use A4 paper unless you select &lsquo;Letter&rsquo; in the print dialog each time.  To change this default, simply run the following command which will set the value in <code>/etc/papersize</code>:</p>

<p><code>
sudo dpkg-reconfigure libpaper1
</code></p>

    <p><a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/">The Freakonomics Blog</a> mentioned <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/newspaper/premium/printedition/Sunday/chi-cell_bdaug05,0,3857748.story?coll=chi-newslocalchicago-hed">a story</a> about mobile phone providers knowing that something was happening near the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis due to hugely increased call volumes.  Later in the article there is also a mention of T-Mobile tracking the change in commuting patterns by the movement of cell phones.</p>

<p>Cell phone activity, just like any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack">side-channel attack</a>, can be exploited to learn a lot about a population.  There are certainly legal and privacy implications to such data being made public, but it would be amazing to look at from a research point of view.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Aug  2, 2007</div>
    <p>Almost every time I get into my Mom&rsquo;s car, I find that the radio is coming from the front-right speaker only.  You see, she has an Acura TL which has a stereo that features two main knobs.  Pushing the left knob turns it on or off and turning it adjusts the volume.  The right knob is used for tuning the radio but can also adjust output characteristics (bass, treble, fade and balance) which are cycled through by pushing the knob.  It seems that when attempting to tune the radio she may accidentally push in the knob causing any further turning of said knob to adjust the bass and treble to full and shift the sound all the way to the right side, front most speaker.  This isn&rsquo;t her fault; she&rsquo;s driving and ought to be able to easily fumble with the radio to make adjustments without looking down.  This is a case of bad user interface design.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/07/31/day-2-austria/">Day 2: Austria</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jul 31, 2007</div>
    <p>On our second day in Europe, the first destination was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein">Neuschwanstein</a>, the castle which served as the inspiration for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_Castle">Sleeping Beauty Castle</a> in Disneyland.  First, though, we had to get some breakfast.  Upon greeting the inkeeper, we were told of the breakfast options, &ldquo;Hungry?  Ja, you will have muesli.&rdquo;  In addition to muesli atop some very good yogurt there was a spread of meats and cheeses that would become standard over the next few days.</p>

<p>After breakfast and a short walk around the monastery, the first of many churches, we hopped into the 5 and headed toward Austria which we would skip through on our way to the castle.  After a fairly uneventful drive along some motoroways and a stop in at a tourist info center, we came upon the road that, from looking at the map, seemed to be the best route to Neuschwanstein.  Though it meandered through a valley next to a beautiful blue-green <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plansee">Plansee</a>, this road turned out to be a somewhat undesirable avenue to the schlo&#x00DF;.  Most Americans are aware that smaller cars rule in Europe and being there only reinforces this fact.  A 5 series is a sizable vehicle, but certainly not &ldquo;large&rdquo; by US standards; in Europe, however, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine having to drive anything larger.  The road that we had chosen was two car widths wide, but only barely.  With my right wheels centimeters from the edge of the road (and wooden posts only a decimeter or so from said edge), the wing mirrors of cars passing in the other direction were no more than a hand-width from my own.  In a brand-new car, this is not a relaxing time.  In time, though, I became accustomed to this because of the much greater skill of European drivers.  Generally, you don&rsquo;t have to drive as though everyone around you is incompetent, unlike here in America.</p>

<p>We got to the castle and had to take a vigorous hike up a few kilometers of mountain to reach the castle.  Such a tourist attraction wouldn&rsquo;t survive in the US; Americans won&rsquo;t walk up a hill, they would demand motorized transport.  It was a good walk and lead to some wonderful views from the castle and impressive works within.</p>

<p>After leaving Neuschwanstein, we had to make our way to France for the Formula 1 race the next day.  We hopped in the car and headed West, stopping at a supermarket in Austria to pick up some bottled water.  I mention the water because after studying the numerous varieties we bought two six packs, one marked &ldquo;Naturel&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;Stille.&rdquo;  Turns out the latter has bubbles and the former doesn&rsquo;t, which was opposite our expectations.</p>

<p>When we arrive at our bed and breakfast in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puligny-Montrachet">Puligny-Montrachet</a> the  innkeeper informed us that the nice restaurant would be full since we were there so late, but if we didn&rsquo;t mind something &ldquo;not so fancy,&rdquo; there was a place just a kilometer walk down the road.   Upon arriving at the restaurant we found that it was not far from fancy at all and served a wonderful meal including a final cheese course.  Very French and very, very good.</p>

    <p>Five Iron Frenzy has a very good song entitled <em>Rhubarb Pie</em>, though it fails to give a recipe for the desert.</p>

<pre>
Well lately I've been thinkin'
about some good home cookin',
just like that I haven't eaten'
in the longest time.
Now I like potato chips,
please don't get me wrong.
But I haven't tasted mama's rhubarb pie in so very long.

Rhubarb pie, in the summer.
Rhubarb pie, made by my mother.
Nothing better in the winter,
than rhurbarb pie after dinner.

Twinkes may be better,
than a hole in the sweater,
and a hole in the sweater,
beats a poke in the eye.
If I had my choice,
I'd leave this gas station store.
And then I'd travel back in time,
and I'd sit down and have some more.

Rhubarb pie, in the summer.
Rhubarb pie, made by my mother.
Nothing better in the winter,
than rhurbarb pie after dinner.

Looking at the picture,
in the Sunday paper,
of the politician, he's talkn' to the press.
He looks like he's been eating lemons all his life.
Well I think mama's rhubarb pie
could save solve more problems overnight.

    <p>There are a number of Ska songs that mention foods or, in this case, a recipe.  The following is from Greenhouse&rsquo;s <em>Palabras</em>, which I have on the album <em>Skarmageddon 3</em> but, as I just found on Amazon, is on their own album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-World-Greenhouse/dp/B000006AUS/ref=pd_bbs_3/105-7333297-0074842?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1184553769&amp;sr=1-3">Tomorrow The World</a>.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/07/13/day-1-picking-up-the-car/">Day 1: Picking Up the Car</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Jul 13, 2007</div>
    <p>After my mom had decided that her new car would be a BMW 535i, I proposed to my parents that they might like to check out BMW&rsquo;s European Delivery program.  Through ED, you work with a US dealer to buy the car and get a 7% price break having to do with taxes and legal mumbo jumbo; it works out to be a good way to subsidize a vacation to Europe.  My parents asked if I&rsquo;d be interested in coming along and so we planned a trip centered, in my mind, around the Formula 1 race in Magny-Cours and visiting the Nurburgring.</p>

<p>We arrived in Munich in the morning and went outside to get a taxi to the BMW European Delivery center.  Outside was a lineup of cream-colored cars, mostly Mercedes E-class wagons and R-class MPVs.  A 220d E-class pulled up, we loaded our bags and proceeded towards Munich.  The drive along the motorway was fun because, in addition to reaching upwards of 160 Km/h, I saw numerous cars that I had previously only heard about on <em>Top Gear</em>.  At the European Delivery center, we were told that the car would take about 45 minutes to prepare.  We walked upstairs to the cafe and had some coffee and German snacks.  This will be the only time that the word &ldquo;snacks&rdquo; will be what Americans understand to be a small or partial meal; throughout the rest of the trip, it seemed that what Germans call a snack most others would call a good lunch.  Also, in Germany, what looks to be a croissant probably has eggs and ham inside.  These items are tasty.</p>

<p>After waiting a spell, we walked around the lot outside checking out the numerous diesel and 1-series cars that never make it to the US.  We headed back inside to wait a bit more and after about an hour and a half someone approached with the papers to sign over the car.  He explained to us the insurance that came with it (which is all the coverage you need, it seems) and go over other paperwork.  We then headed to the garage to get a quick rundown of the car&rsquo;s features.  After hearing about how many horsepowers [sic] the car has, we loaded our luggage into the 5er&rsquo;s trunk, which is significantly larger than that of either of my parents&rsquo; current cars, a Volvo S80 and Acura TL.  Once loaded, we bid &ldquo;auf wiedersehen&rdquo; to the friendly Germans and my dad makes his way through the unnecessarily small garage door and we are on our way to driving the car, which had only 1 mile on the odometer, through Europe.</p>

<p>We headed towards the Bavarian Alps where we would spend our first night in a small town named Ettal, home to a magnificent monastery which, of course, brews the local beer.  After sitting down for a late lunch with a half-liter of the aforementioned beer we walked to the far end of town, which took all of 5 minutes.  We hopped back into the car at that point and took a short drive to neighboring towns to explore a few churches and pick up some bottled water.</p>
