    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 21, 2007</div>
    <p>It is generally accepted that when developing Perl, you should be using warnings (<code>use warnings</code>) and recommended that you go a step further with <code>use strict</code>, which forces the declaration of variables with <code>my</code> before they are used, among other things.  Beyond these two, however, is the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.8/ext/B/B/Lint.pm"><code>B::Lint</code></a> module that performs <a href="http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/lib/B/Lint.html">further checks on your code</a>.  Using it couldn&rsquo;t be simpler; simply pass the option <code>-MO=Lint,all</code> to the Perl command when invoking your program.  The <code>-M</code> option tells Perl that you want to use the module specified, and &rsquo;<code>,all</code>&rsquo; is an option passed to the Lint module, telling it to perform all checks, which is probably what you want.  If you have some bad habit, or want it to specifically skip some checks, you can add that on to the argument list, prepending the option listed in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.8/ext/B/B/Lint.pm">the documentation</a> with &lsquo;no-&rsquo;.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 20, 2007</div>
    <p>Many people spend their Sunday mornings going to church for an hour or two, which I argue is a waste of time.  I don&rsquo;t expect to convince anyone to give up religion altogether by saying this, but that&rsquo;s really beside the point; church is a waste of time, even for the religious.  From a theological perspective, God wants you to respect him and obey the tenets of your religion, but most of all, religion is supposed to help you have a good life.  Now, I&rsquo;m sure some people do get a lot out of hearing a sermon once a week, or meeting with like-minded people, but undoubtedly many simple see it as a necessary chore to maintaining their faith.  My alternative is simple: exercise.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the CDC, AMA or any number of other health-minded organizations, the vast majority of Americans are significantly overweight and get much less exercise then they ought to.  Quite simply, spending an hour or two every Sunday exercising would greatly improve this situation and is significantly beneficial from a psychological standpoint as well.  On the surface, it would seem that a religious sermon would be more beneficial for mental well being than physical exercise.  Studies show, however, that the mental benefits resulting from exercise are as profound as the physiological ones.  Exercise improves mood, alertness and overall affect for days afterward.  A good sermon can change ones life, or improve mood as well, but most sermons aren&rsquo;t that inspiring, and hearing someone talk does a lot less for preventing a heart attack than regular exercise.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 18, 2007</div>
    <p>I recently got a bluetooth headset to use with my Motorola Razr and it works wonderfully, with the one drawback that having bluetooth enabled on the phone all the time reduces its battery life from 5-6 days standby, to 3-4.  I thought that turning bluetooth on and off was a pain, requiring navigating 6 menus deep to do so, until I saw the option for shortcuts in another configuration menu.  Shortcuts are easy to setup and make doing anything, including enabling or disabling bluetooth, a snap.</p>

<p>To setup a shortcut, you simply navigat to the menu option you want as a shortcut, in this case Settings &gt; Connection &gt; Bluetooth Link &gt; Setup &gt; Power.  Then, highlight &lsquo;on&rsquo; and hold down the menu key (top middle button) until a popup asks you if you want to assign a shortcut.  Say yes, and then assign it the key &#39;1&rsquo;, the default.  Do the same for &#39;off&rsquo; in the bluetooth power menu, assigning it the key &#39;2&rsquo;.  Now, you can simply press the menu button and then 1 or 2 to turn bluetooth on or off.  Shortcuts can be altered from the Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Shortcuts menu.  I&rsquo;m very happy that Motorola included the shortcuts feature, in particular because the Razr&rsquo;s interface is so blindingly slow.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 15, 2007</div>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn">Representative Marsha Blackburn </a> (R, TN) made the most blatant invocation of patriotism as a scare tactic that I&rsquo;ve ever heard in the debate over the non-binding resolution to condemn President Bush&rsquo;s troop surge.</p>

<blockquote>
Rep. Blackburn: I think the question we have to ask is who&rsquo;s side are you on?  Who&rsquo;s side are you on?  Are you on the side of freedom?  Are you on the side of allowing the terrorists to get an upper hand?
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, could you be more of a fear monger?  Remember, if you don&rsquo;t support a war in which thousands of American soldiers have died, countless more (really, find the statistics) have been maimed and costs us billions each year, then you&rsquo;re on the side of the terrorists.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/02/14/bash-slash-bin-slash-tar-argument-list-too-long/">bash: /bin/tar: Argument list too long</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Feb 14, 2007</div>
    <p>Anyone who has worked with large numbers of files has seen the error &rsquo;<code>Argument list too long</code>&rsquo; returned by a command before, usually something like <code>cp</code> or <code>rm</code>.  Eventually, they find <code>xargs</code> and all is well again; rather than globbing directly, you use <code>find</code> and <code>xargs</code> to feed the intended command:</p>

<pre>
~/tmp$ ls | wc -l
77029
~/tmp$ cp * /foo/bar/
bash: /bin/cp: Argument list too long
~/tmp$ find . -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} cp {} /foo/bar/
</pre>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, that final command is running find, which simply prints a list of the files in the current directory.  <code>xargs</code> then passes a not-too-long subset of that list to <code>cp</code> in batches, replacing the {} with said list.  The <code>-print0</code> tells <code>find</code> to terminate each filename with a null character rather than the default newline, so that weird filenames work; the corresponding option <code>-0</code> must be used with <code>xargs</code> so that it looks for that syntax.  Now, on to the problem of the day.</p>

<p>I know <code>xargs</code>, but for the problem I had, I didn&rsquo;t think it would help (more on that later).  I wanted to <code>tar</code> up a whole bunch of files, too many for the command line to handle.  The solution was simple, for <code>tar</code> provides an option to receive its list of files that makeup an archive from a file:</p>

<pre>
~/tmp$ find . -print > baz.lst
~/tmp$ tar -cf baz.tar --files-from baz.lst
</pre>

<p>Simple.  There&rsquo;s probably a way to one-line that, but simply piping the output of <code>find</code> to tar with <code>--files-from -</code> didn&rsquo;t work, and I didn&rsquo;t spend any more time trying to figure it out.  As I said previously, I didn&rsquo;t think <code>xargs</code> would help, but I pulled up the <code>tar</code> manpage and, using the <code>-r</code> option, you can append to an existing archive, which could work in conjunction with <code>xargs</code> just fine.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  9, 2007</div>
    <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve seen evidence of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K">Year 2000 problem</a>, but Amazon insists on <a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/104-9106441-1564711?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=professional+xml&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">this search page</a> that an XML book was published in 1901.<img id="image100" src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/1901.jpg" alt="XML book published in 1901" /></p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/02/07/tar-over-ssh/">tar Over SSH</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  7, 2007</div>
    <p><code>scp</code> is great for ease of use, but if you&rsquo;re transferring numerous files, small ones in particular, it isn&rsquo;t the fastest method.  <code>tar</code>, however, is very well suited to gathering small files into a single unit, but <code>tar</code>ing the files, <code>scp</code>ing the tarball and then un-<code>tar</code>ing on the other end is inefficient; we have pipes in unix for a reason.  Like all good command line utilities, tar can dish out and accept input from a pipe, so this is really quite straightforward:</p>

<p><code>
tar cf - sourcedir/ | ssh user@dest_host tar xf - -C /destination/path
</code></p>

<p>Make note of those naked dashes - they are the secret to this whole operation.  First we call the <code>tar</code> command with the options to <b>c</b>reate a tarball and that the <b>f</b>ilename to output immediately follows the options; in this case, we tell it to pipe the output to <code>stdout</code>.  Finally, we give the first <code>tar</code> command the list of files (a directory in this example) that we want sent.  The output of that tar command (the tarball itself, since we directed output to <code>stdout</code>) gets piped to <code>ssh</code> which is invoked like you normally would, except with a command to run tacked on the end.  As soon as <code>ssh</code> connects to the destination host, it simply runs <code>tar</code>, which listens for an input file coming from <code>stdin</code> that it will unpack into the directory given by <code>-C</code>.</p>

<p><addendum>
I noticed that a lot of people Google for &ldquo;tar over scp&rdquo;, which might be your first thought if you&rsquo;ve never done this before.  This note is just to help those people out, because this is most likely the solution they are in search of.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/02/06/setting-up-ubuntu-for-building-kernel-modules/">Setting Up Ubuntu for Building Kernel Modules</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  6, 2007</div>
    <p>When you build kernel modules or other programs that depend upon the kernel you need to have the kernel source configured per the currently running kernel.  To see what kernel your machine is running, simply run <code>uname -a</code>.  To setup your machine to allow things to build against the kernel, you first need the source for your currently running kernel:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
export KERNEL_VERSION=`uname -r|cut -d '-' -f 1`
sudo aptitude install linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION
cd /usr/src/
sudo tar jxf linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION.tar.bz2
sudo ln -s linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION linux
ln -s /usr/src/linux /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
</pre>

<p>First, in order to get things to build against the kernel you have to alter a single file to match the kernel you&rsquo;re running.  Run <code>uname -r</code> and note everything following the first three decimal-separated numbers:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
$ uname -r
2.6.17-10-386
</pre>

<p>Just use a text editor (vi!) and edit <code>/usr/src/linux/Makefile</code>, changing the <code>EXTRAVERSION</code> variable to match yours from above:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 17
#EXTRAVERSION = .14-ubuntu1
EXTRAVERSION = -10-386
NAME=Crazed Snow-Weasel
</pre>

<p>Next, you need to get the .config for the running kernel and setup the kernel source:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash;">
sudo cp /boot/config-`uname -r` /usr/src/linux/.config
cd /usr/src/linux
make oldconfig
make prepare0
make scripts
</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it.  Now you should be able to build things, like kernel modules, against the kernel source.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  5, 2007</div>
    <p>My local NPR station, <a href="http://www.wamu.org">WAMU</a> has been running an advertisement for IBM federal services and they mention the URL, which is spoken as &ldquo;ibm.com backslash foo backslash bar,&rdquo; which won&rsquo;t work if you type it into your interweb browser.  Really, no one uses the Windows command line for anything real, who still thinks with backslashes?</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  4, 2007</div>
    <p>I just finish reading Sam Harris&rsquo; <em>Letter to a Christian Nation</em>, which is a very good book.  At one point he notes that the bible stipulates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a> is exactly 3.  I wondered how such a book would lay out mathematical constants, but it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward:</p>

<blockquote>
The sea was then cast; it was made with a circular rim, and measured ten cubits across, five in height, and thirty in circumference.
Under the brim, gourds encircled it, ten to the cubit all the way around; the gourds were in two rows and were cast in one mold with the sea.
</blockquote>

<p>Kings 7:23-24</p>

<blockquote>
He also made the molten sea. It was perfectly round, ten cubits in diameter, five in depth, and thirty in circumference
</blockquote>

<p>II Chronicles 4:2</p>

<p>I must say that it&rsquo;s a weak argument, because they could be simply approximations by an observer, but it&rsquo;s funny nonetheless.</p>
