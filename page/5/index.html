    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 19, 2009</div>
    <p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3455135080/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3319/3455135080_1a853a6011.jpg" alt="Completed Zombie Defense Station" width="500" height="233" /></a></p>

<p>I have finally completed my Zombie Defense Station.Â  Inspired by <a title="Craftster Zombie Defense Station" href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=202668.0">this post</a> that made it around the internet a few months ago, my kit contains a <a title="Sig P226 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_P226">Sig P226</a> handgun, a <a title="Franchi SPAS-12 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchi_SPAS-12">Franchi SPAS-12</a> shotgun (as seen inÂ  <a title="Jurrasic Park on IMFDB" href="http://www.imfdb.org/index.php?title=Jurassic_Park#Franchi_SPAS-12">Jurassic Park</a>), and a<a title="Gerber Gator Machete" href="http://www.amazon.com/Gerber-22-41576-Gator-Machete-Sheath/dp/B000Q9BBZI"> Gerber Gator</a> machete, which looks unnecessarily evil.</p>

<p>The construction was pretty easy and consists of the following parts
<ul>
    <li>&frac14; inch beech plywood</li>
    <li>1x4 pine plank</li>
    <li>&frac12; inch pine square</li>
    <li>&frac12; inch dowel</li>
    <li>3/16 inch thick plexiglass</li>
    <li>Stencils from <a href="http://www.stencilease.com/">StencilEase</a></li>
    <li>Airsoft guns</li>
    <li>Gerber Gator machete</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3394065314/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3394065314_77242815ae_m.jpg" alt="15 inch machete saw" width="240" height="160" /></a></p>

<p>The first thing I did was get the airsoft guns and the machete, so that I could decide how big to make the enclosure.Â  I bought the SPAS-12 online at the suggestion of my roommate when I said that I just wanted an awesome looking shotgun.Â  We then trekked to various stores in the area in search of machetes.Â  After turning up empty handed at OSH, Home Depot, and Target we hit the jackpot in Sports Authority&rsquo;s camping section.Â  For some reason, Gerber makes, and Sports Authority carries, this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3394065314/">15 inch, saw-back machete</a>.Â  While I think it is absolutely unnecessary for camping purposes, the Gerber Gator is a great zombie knife.</p>

<p>I settled on 34 inches long and 15 inches high, since that fit the SPAS-12 nicely with room for the machete underneath.Â  I cut the box perimeter, screwed it square, and then screwed the back of the box to that.Â  I affixed some 3.5 inch long pieces of &frac12; inch pine square to the corners, upon which the plexiglass would later rest.Â  To mount the guns, I used some 2 and 3 inch long pieces of &frac12; in dowel that are screwed in place from the back of the box.Â  The machete is held in place by some small metal hooks that I got in the Home Depot hardware aisle.</p>

<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3406616916/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/3406616916_4a23319e58_m.jpg" alt="15 inch machete saw" width="240" height="116" /></a></p>

<p>After the box was all assembled, I tossed a coat of gray paint on the inside, and bright red around the perimeter.Â  I cut a piece of 3/16 plexiglass with a razor knife (doesn&rsquo;t work very well - is there a better way?) and stenciled it using the stick-on stencils I orderd from <a href="http://www.stencilease.com/">StencilEase</a>.Â  To put the plexiglass into place, I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/3M-Scotch-Removable-Mounting-Squares/dp/B001B0D46K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=office-products&amp;qid=1240125975&amp;sr=8-3">3m Removable Mounting Squares</a>.</p>

<p>My house is now safe from zombie attacks.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2009/04/17/what-is-crossfit/">What is CrossFit?</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 17, 2009</div>
    <p>Distilled down to the simplest terms, <a href="http://crossfit.com">CrossFit</a> workouts are about <strong>intensity, variability, and functionality</strong>.</p>

<p>The values of CrossFit&rsquo;s World Class Fitness, are often <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/start-how.html">summarized in 100 words</a>:
<blockquote>Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&amp;J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc. hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.</blockquote>
If all that is too simplified, let me elaborate.  CrossFit is a workout regiment that embodies the above mentioned values.  Unlike so many &ldquo;gym rats&rdquo; who think in disparate terms of cardiovascular and strength training, CrossFit does away with these distinctions for a methodology that is driven by results.  Personal trainers at <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Globo%20Gym">Globo Gym</a> encourage long cardio stints of an hour or more &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; with similarly long sessions of strength training using <a href="http://www.nautilus.com">Nautilus</a> machines.  In contrast, CrossFit workouts are mixed modal functional movements, performed at high intensity.</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference and what make CrossFit better?</strong></p>

<p>First, the focus on functional movements rather than isolated muscles.  CrossFit not only trains your entire body to actually be used, but trains you in how to use your body to it&rsquo;s fullest extent.  Instead of a leg press machine, shoulder press machine, and lat pull-down, CrossFit workouts involve similar exercises, the squat, push press, and pull-up, either with bodyweight or barbells.  Performing those latter exercises, which are done outside of the support of weight machines, means that technique, not just raw strength, is an important factor.  Your body has to employ numerous minor muscles in concert to complete the moves safely and effectively.  Ask yourself: do you have a machine guiding you to lift that dresser when helping a friend move?</p>

<p>Variety is a key part of CrossFit.Â  The Workout Of the Day repeats on the scale of months and years - you can do CrossFit for quite some time before you repeat any single workout, and at the rate we&rsquo;re going it&rsquo;ll be a long time before any 3 days have the same prescription.Â  This unique aspect of CrossFit is vitally important not only because keeps you from getting bored with exercise but it also keeps your body in limbo - there&rsquo;s know way to prepare for the next move when it&rsquo;s always different.Â  This variety increases your ability to function optimally in the face of any task that is thrown at you, be it a new sport or a true emergency.Â  Greg Glassman, the founder of CrossFit describes the importance of variability thusly:
<blockquote>We don&rsquo;t have the agility of gymnasts, the power of a weightlifter, or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility, power, and endurance than any gymnast, weightlifter or marathoner. We do your stuff almost as good as you, you canâ€™t do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can.</blockquote>
What he&rsquo;s saying that CrossFit athletes may not have the same ultimate performance in a single domain that specialists athletes have, we have a much broader portfolio of abilities. While the average marathon runner may be able to keep that sustained effort for hours, but they can&rsquo;t jump more than 18 inches or lift their body weight off the ground. The weightlifter may be able to toss twice his weight overhead, but would suffer if asked to run a mile or do 20 pull-ups.</p>

<p>The intensity of CrossFit is, to me, the central factor that differentiates it from the way most people exercise.  At the Globo Gym, you&rsquo;ll see folks do their cardio workout, perhaps running on the treadmill, spinning on a stationary bike, or pedaling on a elliptical machine for 30 to 45 minutes.  Then, they&rsquo;ll amble around the weight machines for an hour or more, doing 3 sets of 10 with a minute of rest in between; guys who are trying to &ldquo;get big&rdquo; will split the weight session between &ldquo;lats &amp; back&rdquo; on day, &ldquo;chest &amp; biceps&rdquo; another, and &ldquo;legs&rdquo; the third.  It all seems very organized, takes a lot of dedication and time.</p>

<p>In contrast, CrossFit workouts are usually 20-30 minutes and the longest ones take 45 to complete.  That&rsquo;s it.  What do we do in that time?  A whole lot more work than most people do in their entire 2-3 hour gym sessions, thanks to the ever present intensity.  Even in CrossFit strength workouts like <strong>DT</strong> (3 rounds for time of <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#WOD1">155lbs. deadlift x 12, clean x 12, jerk x 6</a>), there&rsquo;s a note that the workout is &ldquo;for time&rdquo; â€” no ambling around between sets in this workout.  The reason this intensity is important is because is teaches you how to use the maximum extent of your body; to actually employ your muscles to their fullest.  Intensity also plays into another big question that people have about CrossFit:</p>

<p><strong>What about cardio?</strong></p>

<p>Ahh, yes, what about cardio?  Surely because we never do any long sessions of running, CrossFitters can&rsquo;t have any endurance or stamina.  Wrong.  The widely touted measure of aerobic stamina and endurance is VO2 max, the amount of oxygen that your body can consume during sustained aerobic exercise â€” medium intensity stuff like distance running or biking.  There&rsquo;s a misconception that long bouts of aerobic exercise are what is required to build stamina and endurance, but this simply isn&rsquo;t true.  In the same way muscles must be taken beyond their limits and torn to stimulate growth, your ability to process oxygen must be pushed out of equilibrium in order to increase your capacity to process it (see <a href="http://journal.crossfit.com/2004/06/what-about-cardio-by-greg-glas.tpl">CrossFit Journal issue 22</a>; ask me if you&rsquo;re really interested).  Running at some level below your aerobic threshold (i.e. less than 100% VO2 max) will do little if anything to increase this ability.  To push it out of equilibrium and induce growth you have to workout at 200% or more of your aerobic ability.  In metabolic terms, you need to work the high-intensity phosphagenic and glycolytic pathways in order to improve the medium-low intensity aerobic pathway.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>

<p>To really get CrossFi, you must understand <a href="http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/CFJ-trial.pdf">what fitness really is</a> (PDF) in the CrossFit view.  First, CrossFit sees fitness as including ten metrics: cardiovascular endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy.  Second is the ability to not just perform well at certain measures of fitness, but to perform admirably at any task that is thrown at you.  The CrossFit games, which determines who is the fittest CrossFitter each year, embraces this â€” the competitors don&rsquo;t know what the competition will entail until the day of the competition.  Rounding out CrossFit&rsquo;s standard for being &ldquo;fit&rdquo; is competency in each of the three metabolic pathways: phosphagenic, glycolytic, and oxidative.  Fulfilling CrossFit&rsquo;s standard means that one has total fitness, fitness across the broadest range of measures and challenges.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to &ldquo;get big&rdquo;, then by all means, stick to a rotating schedule of isolating muscles, hit the protein powder hard, skip the cardio, and enjoy the ditzy chicks you can pick up at the bar.</p>

<p>If you dig that ematiated Ethiopian look, like to run marathons, and want to pick up the vegan chick from Whole Foods to have some very boney sex, then keep at those super cardio sessions!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re truly interested in challenging yourself, being in the best shape possible, and improving your abilities across numerous domains, then <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-affiliates/">find a local CrossFit gym</a>, and get in their boot camp.Â  You&rsquo;ll thank me later.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Apr  8, 2009</div>
    <p>Crontabs are incredibly useful devices - the easiest way to regularly run a command at a specified time.  The unfortunate part is that, as an operating system level function, their content is easily lost if you aren&rsquo;t careful about backups, or haphazardly reinstall your Unix system.  A simple trick I learned is to keep your crontab entries in a file, say, <code>.crontab</code> in your home directory, rather than just editing your crontab directly (i.e. <code>crontab -e</code>).  That way, you can be sure that all your important data, including your own user crontab, is in your home directory, and that&rsquo;s the one important thing to backup.  To install a new crontab, simply run <code>crontab ~/.crontab</code> after having edited that file and your cron system will install your changes.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 31, 2009</div>
    <p>Like any good <a href="http://www.geekcode.com">geek</a>, I have a naming system for my computers and associated devices.  Real systems &#x2014; which I define as those that run SSH &#x2014; are named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_Emperors">Roman Emperors</a>; things that are computer-like but don&rsquo;t run SSH are named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_generals">Roman generals</a>.</p>

<p>I have also taken to naming each of the disks attached to a machine after a land mass somehow connected to the Emperor it is named after.  My main desktop is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a> with the disks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri">Capri</a>, where Caligula lived under the care of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania">Mauretania</a>, which Tiberius annexed, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania">Germania</a>, where Caligula accompanied his father on military campaigns as a young child.  When I got a USB drive for keeping off-site backups, I needed to name it and though ships of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Navy">Roman Navy</a> would be appropriate.  What a pleasant surprise to find that Caligula had built a ship to transport the obelisk in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter%27s_Square">St. Peter&rsquo;s Square</a> which when it was found in the 1950&rsquo;s was named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula%27s_Giant_Ship">Caligula&rsquo;s &ldquo;Giant Ship&rdquo;</a>.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2009/03/15/diy-r-strap/">DIY R-Strap</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 15, 2009</div>
    <p>After seeing the <a href="http://www.blackrapid.com/">BlackRapid R-Strap</a> mentioned on <a href="http://photojojo.com/content/buy-this/diy-camera-r-strap/">Photojojo</a> I knew that I wanted one for greater convenience when walking about with my camera.  I hate neck straps because they get in the way when you aren&rsquo;t using them and make you look like a fat tourist when you are.  I might as well break out the khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirt.  Aside from the not-exactly-cheap $50 price tag, I figured that and R-Strap was something I should DIY.</p>

<p>My version of the R-Strap is a simple affair, consisting of the plate off my Manfrotto ballhead and some gear from the climbing section of REI.  To begin with, I got myself a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/722354">2 foot long, 18mm runner</a> which I wear like a bandolier.  To this, I attach a simple <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/782255">locking carabiner</a> - I just chose the smallest and cheapest one.  I thought about using chintzy keychain carabiners, but then realized I&rsquo;ll be hangning thousands of dollars of gear off of it and went with the slightly more expensive real thing.</p>

<p>Finally, I tied a small loop of <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/784296">nylon cord</a> to the D-ring on my tripod plate, to which I clip the carabiner.  If your tripod plate has a large enough ring, you could clip directly to it.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2009/03/09/track-day-diary/">Track Day Diary</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Mar  9, 2009</div>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into cars, a weekend at the racetrack is as good as it gets.  The local chapters of car clubs (<a href="http://bmwcca.org">BMW CCA</a>, <a href="http://pca.org">PCA</a>, <a href="http://ferrariclubofamerica.org">FCA</a>, <a href="http://scca.org">SCCA</a> etc.) rent a track for the weekend, organize instructors from member volunteers, and allow you to Drive Like You Mean It on a real racetrack while teaching you to be a much better driver.  Track weekends are variously called Driver&rsquo;s Schools, High Performance Driver Education (HPDE), or simply track days.  The weekends aren&rsquo;t cheap &#x2014; the <a href="http://nccbmwcca.org">NCC BMW CCA</a> I used to drive with charges $430 and the <a href="http://ggcbmwcca.org">GGC BMW CCA</a> $525 &#x2014; but are worth every penny.  Your first time can be quite daunting, since it&rsquo;s hard to know what to expect or how to prepare.  Hopefully this overview of my most recent day with the Golden Gate Chapter at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infineon_Raceway">Infineon Raceway</a> will be helpful.</p>

<h2>Inspection</h2>

<p>Two to three weeks prior to the track day, I get my car inspected by a mechanic I trust.  They usually charge an hour of labor, but if you&rsquo;re lucky you can get it thrown in with some maintenance you require &#x2014; ask other club members.  All clubs I know of require an inspection to ensure that your car is in tip top shape for being pushed to the limit.  Common to all such inspections is that you have sufficient brake pad material left (more than half the pad) and that the brake fluid has been changed within the past six months.  Other than those two specifics, most cars in good condition won&rsquo;t need anything special done to work on the track, especially your first time.</p>

<h2>Packing</h2>

<p>On the Thursday before my track weekend, I start packing.  I have a track/autocross box that contains paper towels, windshield cleaner (Stoner Invisible Glass), a quart of oil, a good air gauge, duct tape, the manual for my car, a couple of common wrenches, a torque wrench, a breaker bar and a bottle of white liquid shoe polish.  Every day at the track I will use the glass cleaner to keep my windows super-clean, the air gauge to set my tire pressure, and the torque wrench to check my wheel bolts.  I often end up adding a bit of oil throughout the course of the weekend and I&rsquo;ve found the duct tape useful on a few occasions to fix that stupid plastic undertray on my E36.</p>

<p>As for the shoe polish, it&rsquo;s one of the best tools for adjust air pressure.  Simply put a bit of shoe polish on the sidewall of the tire and onto the shoulder block of the tread; when you get off the track, see where the polish has disappeared and adjust the tire pressure accordingly.</p>

<p>Additionally, I pack my portable air compressor (though most tracks have air available), a couple of towels, my helmet, and tech inspection form &#x2014; the last two being a absolute requirements, since you can&rsquo;t drive without them.</p>

<p>Personal stuff I bring includes a cooler filled with lots of water, some sandwiches, apples, and energy bars.  Being <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dinomite">something of a photographer</a> I bring along my camera, since hot cars driving on a racetrack makes for good pictures.  I also toss in some reading material and the Eagle Scout in me requires a bag with a complete change of clothes.  If you&rsquo;re coming home each day (which I do, since the track is only about an hour away), you probably don&rsquo;t need the extra clothes, but do bring a sweatshirt and jacket, even if the forecast is for highs in the 80s.  For those of us who live in urban areas, we aren&rsquo;t used to being up at 6 in the morning &#x2014; it can be pretty cold then.  Also, unlike that NASCAR crap, you will drive rain or shine and in cold weather, always with the windows down.  It won&rsquo;t be a fun time if you&rsquo;re cold.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>On Friday, I come home from work, pack all of my gear into the car, and head to bed around 10PM.  I won&rsquo;t actually get there until 11 and probably won&rsquo;t fall asleep until later still, but since I have to leave the house at 5:30AM to get to the track by 7, I make the effort to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.  Why 7AM?  The drivers meeting will be at 8AM, the instructors will do ride-along intro laps thereafter and the track opens at 9AM.  All track events require everyone to attend the drivers meeting and, like the rest of the day, things run a very strict time table.  Renting a track is very expensive and everyone wants to make the most of it, so be on time and build yourself some extra cushion, especially if it&rsquo;s your first time out.</p>

<h2>To The Track</h2>

    <p>Americans aren&rsquo;t good at saving money.  The average amount of disposable income—income less taxes, not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income">discretionary income</a>—saved has dropped from 11% in the 1980s to 1% before the start of the current recession.  A graph is appropriate here:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not some anti-materialist nazi, but that downward march is the increased confusion that Americans have between &ldquo;wants&rdquo; and &ldquo;needs&rdquo;.  Sure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wage">real wages</a> <a href="http://www.workinglife.org/wiki/Wages+and+Benefits%3A+Real+Wages+%281964-2004%29">have decreased</a>  over this time period, but not nearly at the rate that savings has slumped.</p>

<p>The uptick for 2009?  That&rsquo;s the just-released data for January of this year which pegs the rate at 5%, up from 1.8% in 2008 and 0.5% the previous year.  August of 2005 even featured a rate of <strong>negative</strong> 2.7%, a feat matched only by the -0.2% rate in 2001.  Though I would generally argue that people thinking about their future rather than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09view.html?ex=1362718800&amp;en=e0525c458b2d83df&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">instant gratification</a> is a wonderful change, increased saving isn&rsquo;t what an economy needs to break out of a recession.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Feb  8, 2009</div>
    <p>There are a lot of old-school Unix commands that can be strung together to form miniatures programs a solution where one doesn&rsquo;t already exist.  Often times, they&rsquo;re great for nothing more than trimming the output from command line programs to make ocular searching easier.  <code>awk</code> is one of these great little text processing utilities, though I usually find myself using it in only it&rsquo;s simplest fashion: to print a specific record from a line of input.
<pre class="brush: bash;">Caligula:~$ df -h|awk &#39;{print $2}&#39;
698Gi
298Gi
190Gi</pre>
That <code>awk</code> command, <code>&#39;{print $2}&#39;</code>, is more than a bit cumbersome to type, so I keyed up a quick function in my <code>.bashrc</code> to make performing this quick operation easier:
<pre class="brush: bash;">Caligula:~$ df -h|fawk 2
698Gi
298Gi
190Gi</pre>
And the function:
<pre class="brush: bash;">function fawk {
    first=&quot;awk &#39;{print &quot;
    last=&quot;}&#39;&quot;
    cmd=&quot;${first}$${1}${last}&quot;
    eval $cmd
}</pre></p>
