    <div class="article-title-date">May  1, 2006</div>
    <p>As I read more about cryptography (I&rsquo;m currently making my way through the great tome, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471117099/sr=8-1/qid=1145849010/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6924799-8398511?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Applied Cryptography</a>) I&rsquo;ve been thinking more about random number generators.  Whenever you read about cryptography or how they build slot machines (Kevin Mitnick covers this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764569597/sr=8-1/qid=1145849136/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6924799-8398511?%5Fencoding=UTF8">The Art of Intrusion</a>) there is talk of how bad computer random number generators are, particularly the standard functions that are part of Java, libc or .NET.  Even if you take the time to seed them, the pseudo-randomness is of quite low quality.  I just found an article on some <a href="http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/random_number_generation">random number generators you can implement yourself</a>.  Cool.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 28, 2006</div>
    <p>News to me: you can use The Internet from planes now; I knew that this was in the works, but I didn&rsquo;t think it had actually been implemented yet.  Apparently Lufthansa (others?) has WiFi planes that communicate with the outside world via satellite links.  As is thoroughly explained in <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2006/04/tracking_plane_flight_on_inter.shtml">this post</a>, the plane connects to a geostationary satellite and has it&rsquo;s own /24 network.  The planes intelligently decide which satellite to use based upon which will produce shorter routing at the ground station and are able to dynamically change this throughout the flight.  As the Renesys blogger shows, the planes announce their route changes thus allowing graceful switches amongst the satellites.  Cool.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 23, 2006</div>
    <p>Ever drive behind an ambulance and notice the chains hanging from the rear axel?  I&rsquo;ve always wondered what those were for and today listening to CarTalk they suggested to a guy who was complaining about being shocked by his car to use a ground strap or chains that would drag on the ground to&hellip;ground the car.  For ambulances, I would bet that being at ground potential is importand for their instruments (EKG?) or perhaps they just don&rsquo;t want to shock people.  Interesting.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 16, 2006</div>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> for some time now and I absolutely love it.  Not only can I access my bookmarks from any machine, it&rsquo;s easy for me to point people to collections of information that I&rsquo;ve made and the organization is far superior to any other mothodology.  The public-ness of it brings up an interesting vulnerability, that of spying using del.icio.us.  Say that you know I write code for some software company and you have been hired to do industrial espionage for a competing firm; you can probably get a good idea of what I&rsquo;m working on by the links that I grab.  Just a thought.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/04/14/logical-fallacy-of-the-day-cum-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc/">Logical Fallacy of the Day: cum hoc ergo propter hoc</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 14, 2006</div>
    <p>One of the most oft encountered logical fallacies, particularly when quoting the outcome of studies or statistics, is that of confusing correlation of variables with causation; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_implies_causation_%28logical_fallacy%29"><strong>cum hoc ergo propter hoc</strong></a> (latin, <em>with this, therefore, because of this</em>).  This fallacy is the root of irrational beliefs, fears and biases in otherwise intelligent and informed people.</p>

<p>This came to light earlier this week in a forum where some people who would generally not be considered bigoted where having a &ldquo;truthful&rdquo; discussion about whay they thought of black people.  Statistics, such as the rate of black men being incarcerated vs. that for white men, were quoted and the crowd all pointed saying, &ldquo;See, they&rsquo;re more likely to go to jail; the stastics don&rsquo;t lie, they&rsquo;re just bad people.&rdquo;  This was from a bunch of people who don&rsquo;t want to be racist, but they found it troubling to agree with the statistics, which are true, agree with their own experiences (bad neighborhoods == black neighborhoods) and yet not see blacks as being inherently predisposed to crime.</p>

<p>The root of their misunderstanding lies in the logical fallacy of assuming that correlation proves causation.  The most important thing to realize when reading studies or statistics is that the correlation of two variables does not mean that they are anything but related.  I recently read of a study done by the US Army which found that the best predictor of whether or not someone would ever be involved in a motorcycle accident was the number of tattoos they had.  Does that mean that tatoos cause motorcycle accidents or cause poeple to be stupid?  No.  All it means is that people with lots of tattoos tend to have motorcycles and ride them more than those without.  Perhaps the root cause is that they&rsquo;re more inclined to take risk, but quite obviously, tattoos don&rsquo;t cause motorcycle riders to crash.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of how to interpret studies, I highly recommend reading <em>Freakonomics</em> by Steven Levitt.  His book examines a number of different situations and a huge amount of data using techniques like regression analysis to find the root causes in otherwise random data.  For the race problem, it basically boils down to the fact that criminal tendencies are not well correlated with race but rather with low education and low income.  Drawing on that, it&rsquo;s quite easy to understand how blacks are still associated with being criminals and easy to see just how long it is going to take for the remanants of a racist society to be removed from our civilization.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2006/04/10/genesis-according-to-george-gamow/">Genesis According to George Gamow</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Apr 10, 2006</div>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0007162219/sr=8-1/qid=1144684215/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8438297-9319959?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe</a> by Simon Singh, an excellent history of all cosmology.  The book starts with the very beginning of astronomical exploration, such as Eratosthenes who was the first to estimate the Earth&rsquo;s diameter.  I&rsquo;m nearing the end of the book (the mid 1900&rsquo;s, shortly after the Big Bang theory was created) and ran across this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gamow">George Gamow</a>&rsquo;s version of the bible&rsquo;s Genesis:</p>

<blockquote>
In the beginning God created Radiation and Ylem. And the Ylem was without shape or number, and the nucleons were rushing madly upon the face of the deep.
<br><br>
And God said: &ldquo;Let there be mass two.&rdquo; And there was mass two. And God saw deuterium, and it was good.
<br><br>
And God said: &ldquo;Let there be mass three.&rdquo; And there was mass three. And God saw tritium, and it was good.
<br><br>
And God continued to call numbers until He came to the transuranium elements. But when He looked back on his work, He saw that it was not good. In the excitement of counting, He had missed calling for mass five, and so, naturally, no heavier elements could have been formed.
<br><br>
God was very disappointed by that slip and wanted to contract the universe again and start everything from the beginning. But that would be much too simple. Instead, being Almighty, God decided to make heavy elements in the most impossible way.
<br><br>
And so God said: &ldquo;Let there be Hoyle.&rdquo; And there was Hoyle. And God saw Hoyle and told him to make heavy elements in any way he pleased.
<br><br>
And so Hoyle decided to make heavy elements in stars, and to spread them around by means of supernova explosions. But in doing so, Hoyle had to follow the blueprint of abundances which God prepared earlier when He had planned to make the elements from Ylem.
<br><br>
Thus, with the help of God, Hoyle made all heavy elements in stars, but it was so complicated that neither Hoyle, nor God, nor anybody else can now figure out exactly how it was done.

    <div class="article-title-date">Mar 29, 2006</div>
    <p>I bought a Shuttle SB86i a few months ago, which is an Intel based small form factor system (<a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/article230-page1.html">reviewed by Silent PC Review</a>) which came with an on-board gigabit ethernet adapter.  This piece is referred to by <code>lspci</code> as a &ldquo;Marvell Technology Groupl Ltd. 88E8053 Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 15)&rdquo; and by <code>dmesg</code> as a &ldquo;Yukon Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T Adapter&rdquo;.  Either way, the chipset is made by SysKonnect and the driver in the kernel tree (sk98lin) just plain doesn&rsquo;t work.  A quick search  (via Google, what else?) turned up <a href="http://www.grad.name/blog/2006/01/28/marvell-gigabit-on-linux/">this post</a> which referenced <a href="http://www.skd.de/e_en/support/driver.html">SysKonnect&rsquo;s driver page</a>.  Fromt the driver page (I chose the &lsquo;SK-9E21D 10/100/1000Base-T Adapter&rsquo; under &#39;PCI Express Desktop Adapter&rsquo;) I was able to get their very simple package to build the kernel module on my Ubuntu system, all you need are the compiled kernel sources for the kernel you&rsquo;re running.  If you don&rsquo;t know anything about your kernel and you&rsquo;re running Ubuntu (Dapper Drake, probably others), run this command as root to get and compile the kernel sources:</p>

<pre><code>
~# KERNEL_VERSION=`uname -r|grep -o "2\.[4|6]\.[1|2|][0-9]"` &&\
 apt-get install linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION &&\
 cd /usr/src && /bin/tar jxf linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION.tar.bz2 &&\
 ln -s linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION linux &&\
 cd linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION &&\
 cp /boot/config-$KERNEL_VERSION-* .config &&\
 make oldconfig && make
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;and then install the driver from SysKonnect.  If you don&rsquo;t know what the above comman does, pick it apart and figure it out!  That&rsquo;s what Linux is all about.
(cool regex, eh?)</p>
